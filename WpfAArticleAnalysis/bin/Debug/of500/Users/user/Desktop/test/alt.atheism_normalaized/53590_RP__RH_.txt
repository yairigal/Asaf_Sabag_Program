On rereading this I decided there was something else Id like 
to add to my earlier comments 
 
Please forgive me if I get any attributions wrong here 
 
Also this isnt really appropriate to talkorigins but I hope 
you all will excuse me just this once as they say

It seems to me that you are misusing physical intuition here  My point is 
that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena 
inappropriately  Remember that there is no such thing as a global frame 
of reference for time  Our minds like to pretend that there is and we  
imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx 4 years off  
from ours on Earth 
This is simply wrong  There is NO global time which can be applied to 
events on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth  This is what 
Special Relativity has taught us  If I am travelling past the Earth at 
a high rate of speed toward AC I can even have a different view of the  
order of the occurance of events on AC versus Earth  Thus the answer to  
the question whats happening on Alpha Centaury NOW is NOT welldefined if 
asked on Earth until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative 
velocities and the like AND it will have different answers for different  
values of these parameters 
Now in the vicinity of a black hole the curvature
