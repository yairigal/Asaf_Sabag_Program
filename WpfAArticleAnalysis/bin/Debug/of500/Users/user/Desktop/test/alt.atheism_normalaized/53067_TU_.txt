SO, LET'S SEE. IF SOME GUY WRITES A PIECE WITH A TITLE THAT IMPLIES
SOMETHING IS THE CASE THEN IT MUST BE SO, IS THAT IT?

THIS SUPPORTS NOTHING. I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS 
PIECE IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN ANOTHER ANTI-ISLAMIC SLANDER JOB.
I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR TITLES, ONLY FOR REAL CONTENT. I CAN LOOK
UP THIS ARTICLE IF I WANT, TRUE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU BCCI WAS _NOT_
AN ISLAMIC BANK. SEEING AS I'M SPENDING MY TIME RESPONDING TO
PROPAGANDA (IN RESPONDING TO THIS LITTLE SUB-THREAD) I REALLY
DON'T FEEL A DEEP NEED TO DO MORE THAN MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE
EFFECT THAT THE PROPAGANDA IS FALSE. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DISCUSS
THE ISSUE MORE SERIOUSLY THEN I'D BE GLAD TO HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION,
PROVIDING REFERENCES, ETC.
