UNFORTUNATELY YOUR PHRASING IS AMBIGUOUS.  RE-WRITING MORE CAREFULLY, WE HAVE
(AT LEAST) TWO POSSIBILITIES.  THE FIRST:

THINGS CALLED "MERCEDES" ARE CARS
THAT GIRL IS CALLED "MERCEDES"
THEREFORE THAT GIRL IS A CAR

THAT IS ENTIRELY VALID AS A PIECE OF LOGICAL DEDUCTION.  IT IS NOT SOUND,
BECAUSE THE FIRST STATEMENT IS FALSE.  SIMILARLY, I WOULD HOLD THAT JIM'S
EXAMPLE IS VALID BUT NOT SOUND.

ANOTHER POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT YOU WROTE IS:

THERE EXISTS AT LEAST ONE CAR CALLED "MERCEDES"
THAT GIRL IS CALLED "MERCEDES"
THEREFORE THAT GIRL IS A CAR

-- WHICH ISN'T VALID.
