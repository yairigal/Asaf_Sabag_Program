>MY PERSONAL OBJECTION IS THAT I FIND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO BE
>CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

IT CAN BE PAINLESS, SO IT ISN'T CRUEL.  AND, IT HAS OCCURRED FREQUENTLY
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME, SO IT IS HARDLY UNUSUAL.

>I DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THE NUMBERS.  A SINGLE INNOCENT LIFE TAKEN
>IS ONE TOO MANY.

BUT, INNOCENTS DIE DUE TO MANY CAUSES.  WHY HAVE YOU SINGLED OUT
ACCIDENTAL OR FALSE EXECUTION AS THE ONE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH?
