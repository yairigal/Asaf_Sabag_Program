IN ARTICLE 28833@MONU6.CC.MONASH.EDU.AU,  DARICE@YOYO.CC.MONASH.EDU.AU (FRED RICE) WRITES:
#IN <1993APR14.143121.26376@BMW.MAYO.EDU> VDP@MAYO.EDU (VINAYAK DUTT) WRITES:
#>SO INSTEAD OF CALLING IT INTEREST ON DEPOSITS, YOU CALL IT *RETURNS ON INVESTEMENTS*
#>AND INSTEAD OF CALLING LOANS YOU CALL IT *INVESTING IN BUSINESS* (THAT IS IN OTHER WORDS
#>FLOATING STOCKS IN YOUR COMPANY). 
#
#NO, INTEREST IS DIFFERENT FROM A RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT.  FOR ONE
#THING, A RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT HAS GREATER RISK, AND NOT A SET RETURN
#(I.E. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU MAKE CAN GO UP OR DOWN, OR YOU MIGHT EVEN
#LOSE MONEY).  THE DIFFERENCE IS, THE RISK OF LOSS IS SHARED BY THE
#INVESTOR, RATHER THAN PRACTICALLY ALL THE RISK BEING TAKEN BY THE
#BORROWER WHEN THE BORROWER BORROWS FROM THE BANK.
#

BUT IS IT DIFFERENT FROM STOCKS ?  IF YOU WISH TO CALL AN INVESTOR IN STOCKS AS
A BANKER, WELL THEN ITS YOUR CHOICE .....

#>RELABELING DOES NOT MAKE IT INTEREST FREE !!
#
#IT IS NOT JUST RELABELING, AS I HAVE EXPLAINED ABOVE.

IT  *IS* RELABELING ...
ALSO ITS STILL NOT INTEREST FREE. THE INVESTOR IS STILL TAKING SOME MONEY ... AS
DIVIDEND ON HIS INVESTMENT ... OFCOURSE THE INVESTOR (IN ISLAMIC *BANKING*, ITS YOUR
SO CALLED *BANK*)  IS TAKING MORE RISK THAN THE USUAL BANK, BUT ITS STILL GETTING SOME
THING BACK IN RETURN .... 

ALSO HAVE YOU HEARD OF JUNK BONDS ???
