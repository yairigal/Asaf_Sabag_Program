   Francis Hitching is the author of among other books 
The Neck of the Giraffe He believes evolution is 
directed by some sort of cosmic force but does not like 
Darwinism  He wrote in this book  The Neck of the 
Giraffe Ticknor  Fields New Haven Connecticut 1982 
p 12 p 4 paperback that 
 
   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the 
   great unifying principle of biology Darwinism after 
   a century and a quarter is in a surprising amount of 
   trouble  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to 
   mean the same thing  But they dont  Evolution of 
   life over a very long period of time is a fact if we 
   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two 
   centuries from geology paleontology molecular biol 
   ogy and many other scientific disciplines  Despite 
   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this 
    the probability that evolution has occurred 
   approaches certainty in scientific terms  On the 
   other hand Darwinism or neoDarwinism its modern 
   version is a theory that seeks to explain evolution 
   It has not contrary to general belief and despite 
   very great efforts been proved 
 
   Research on Hitching turned up the following Hitching is 
basically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien 
tific credentials  In The Neck of the Giraffe he claimed 
to be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute but an 
inquiry to that institute said he was not  He implied in 
the Acknowledgements of The Neck of the Giraffe that 
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing 
of the book but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him 
and had no information about him  Hitching also implied 
that his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins but upon 
inquiry Dawkins stated I know nothing at all about Francis 
Hitching  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char 
latan good for you  His book The Neck of the Giraffe 
is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for 
years 
 
   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on 
Mayan pyramid energy and for some In Search Of episodes 
on BBC television  The reference work Contemporary 
Authors Vol 103 page 208 lists him as a member of the 
Society for Psychical Research the British Society of 
Dowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers  His writ 
ings include Earth Magic Dowsing The Psi Connection 
Mysterious World An Atlas of the Unexplained Fraud 
Mischief and the Supernatural and Instead of Darwin 
 
   Hitchings book spends much of its time attacking Dar 
winian evolution borrowing heavily and uncritically from 
youngearth creationist arguments  Many of Hitchings ref 
erences are lifted from youngearth creationist literature 
rather than being quoted directly from their original 
sources  One magazine had this to say CreationEvolution 
Newsletter 7 No 5 pp 1516 SeptemberOctober 1987 
 
   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society there was 
   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of 
   their journal Biblical Creation p 74 concerning a 
   review of Francis Hitchings 1982 book The Neck of 
   the Giraffe  Hitchings book is strongly anti 
   Darwinist and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre 
   ationists though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist 
   creationists  The letter by creationist Malcolm 
   Bowden author of The Rise of the Evolution Fraud 
   points out that Hitching simply culled his informa 
   tion from the creationist literature  This is indeed 
   the case  many creationist works are cited favorably 
   Anderson Coffin Clark Daly Davidheiser Dewar 
   Gish Morris Segraves Whitcomb and Wysong plus 
   various antiDarwinists  Hitching does cite Bowdens 
   earlier book ApeMen  Fact or Fallacy but Bowden 
   accuses Hitching of lifting several passages and 
   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment 
   in other words plagiarism  Hitchins sic book is 
   largely an exposition of the creationists sic view 
   point from the beginning to almost the end Bowden 
   points out  Hitching is also a paranormalist an 
   advocate of psychic evolution Hitchings book 
   Earth Magic is a wild extremely entertaining and 
   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc 
   tures  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic 
   cataclysms Atlantis pyramidology dowsing ESP 
   miraculous healing and astrology
