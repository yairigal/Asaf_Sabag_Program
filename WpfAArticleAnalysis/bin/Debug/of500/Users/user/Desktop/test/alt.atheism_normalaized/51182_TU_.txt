MOST OF SCOTTY'S FOLLOWUP *WAS* IRRELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION,
BUT THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL, AS THREADS OFTEN QUICKLY EVOLVE AWAY FROM
THE ORIGINAL TOPIC.  WHAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY JIM SPENT SO
MUCH TIME RESPONDING TO WHAT HE REGARDED AS IRRELEVANCIES.

WELL, I GUESS HYPOTHETICAL ADAM WAS "THE MAJORITY OF MANKIND"
SEEING HOW HE WAS THE ONLY MAN AT THE TIME.

I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY "COLLECTIVE," BUT I THINK IT IS AN
INSANE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE.  WHAT SORT OF JUDGE WOULD PUNISH THE
DESCENDANTS FOR A CRIME COMMITTED BY THEIR ANCESTOR?

WELL, I MUST ADMIT THAT YOU PROBABLY READ A.A. MORE OFTEN THAN I READ
THE BIBLE THESE DAYS.  BUT YOU MISSED A COUPLE OF GOOD FOLLOWUPS TO
YOUR POST.  I'M SENDING YOU A PERSONAL COPY OF MY FOLLOWUP WHICH I
HOPE YOU WILL RESPOND TO PUBLICALLY IN A.A.

THE SAGELESS
