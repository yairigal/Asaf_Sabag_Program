I hope there is not one with a subject like this you just have a spiral  What 
would then be a morality of a morality of morals  Labels dont make arguments  
One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be 
interpreted even though this would hardly seem moral  For example The best 
thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough  Hence all actions 
must be weighed against this one statement  whatever helps this goal is 
moral whatever does not is immoral 
 
Of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to 
fulfill a goal one would need a hypermorality to apply to just the methods

Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think 
about it long enough    On the other hand maybe it is our first gut 
reaction  Which  Who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate 
morals  I dont instinctively thing vegetarianism is right the same way I 
instinctively feel torture is wrong but if I thought about it long enough and 
listened to the arguments I could perhaps reason that it was wrong is that 
possible     See the difference
