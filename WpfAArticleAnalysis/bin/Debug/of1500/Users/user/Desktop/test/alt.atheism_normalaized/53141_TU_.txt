>>NATURAL MORALITY MAY SPECIFICALLY BE THOUGHT OF AS A CODE OF ETHICS THAT
>>A CERTAIN SPECIES HAS DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.
>WAIT.  ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ETHICS OR MORALS HERE?

IS THE DISTINCTION IMPORTANT?

>>WE SEE THIS COUNTLESS
>>TIMES IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, AND SUCH A "NATURAL" SYSTEM IS THE BASIS FOR
>>OUR OWN SYSTEM AS WELL.
>HUH?

WELL, OUR MORAL SYSTEM SEEMS TO MIMIC THE NATURAL ONE, IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

>>IN ORDER FOR HUMANS TO THRIVE, WE SEEM TO NEED
>>TO LIVE IN GROUPS,
>HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.  "WE *SEEM* TO NEED".  WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE HIGHLIGHTED
>WORD?

I DON'T KNOW.  WHAT IS WRONG?  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO SURVIVE FOR
A LONG TIME IN THE WILD?  YES, IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT.  HUMANS
ARE A SOCIAL ANIMAL, AND THAT IS A CAUSE OF OUR SUCCESS.

>>AND IN ORDER FOR A GROUP TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY, IT
>>NEEDS SOME SORT OF ETHICAL CODE.
>THIS STATEMENT IS NOT CORRECT.

ISN'T IT?  WHY DON'T YOU THINK SO?

>>AND, BY POINTING OUT THAT A SPECIES' CONDUCT SERVES TO PROPOGATE ITSELF,
>>I AM NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU YOUR TAUTOLOGY, BUT I AM TRYING TO SHOW THAT
>>SUCH ARE EXAMPLES OF MORAL SYSTEMS WITH A GOAL.  PROPOGATION OF THE SPECIES
>>IS A GOAL OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF MORALITY.
>SO ANYBODY WHO LIVES IN A MONAGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT MORAL?  AFTER ALL,
>IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROPOGATION OF THE SPECIES, EVERY MAN SHOULD IMPREGNATE
>AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE.

NO.  AS NOTED EARLIER, LACK OF MATING (SUCH AS ABSTINENCE OR HOMOSEXUALITY)
ISN'T REALLY DESTRUCTIVE TO THE SYSTEM.  IT IS A WORST NEUTRAL.

>FOR THAT MATTER, IN HERDS OF HORSES, ONLY THE DOMINATE STALLION MATES.  WHEN
>HE DIES/IS KILLED/WHATEVER, THE NEW DOMINATE STALLION IS THE ONLY ONE WHO
>MATES.  THESE SEEMS TO BE A CASE OF YOUR "NATURAL SYSTEM OF MORALITY" TRYING
>TO SHOOT ITSELF IN THE FIGURATIVE FOOT.

AGAIN, THE MATING PRACTICES ARE SOMETHING TO BE REEXAMINED...
