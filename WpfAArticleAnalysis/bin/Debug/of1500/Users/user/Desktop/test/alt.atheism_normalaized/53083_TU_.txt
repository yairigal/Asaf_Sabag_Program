  NO. THE CHRISTIANS WERE LEARY OF HAVING AN ATHEIST SPOKESMAN
  (SEEMS SO CLANDESTINE, AND ALL THAT), SO THEY HAD HIM REMOVED.  OF
  COURSE, KEITH IS BUSY EXPLAINING TO HIS FELLOW CAPTIVES HOW HE
  ISN'T REALLY BEING PERSECUTED, SINCE (AFTER ALL) THEY *ARE*
  FEEDING HIM, AND ANY RESISTANCE ON HIS PART WOULD ONLY BE VIEWED
  AS TROUBLE MAKING.  

  I UNDERSTAND HE DID MAKE A BIT OF A FUSS WHEN THEY TATOOED "IN GOD
  WE TRUST" ON HIS FOREHEAD, THOUGH.
