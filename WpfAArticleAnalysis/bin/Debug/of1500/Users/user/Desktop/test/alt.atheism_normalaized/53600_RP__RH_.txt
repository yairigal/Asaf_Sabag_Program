But its STILL HAPPENING  Thats the entire point  Only last month John 
Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of 
arms to Saudi Arabia  The same month we sold jet fighters to the same 
Indonesian government thats busy killing the East Timorese 
 
Its all very well to say Oops we made a booboo better clean up the 
mistake but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake  They do it so 
often that I cant believe its not deliberate  This suspicion is reinforced 
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit 
economy reliant on arms sales
