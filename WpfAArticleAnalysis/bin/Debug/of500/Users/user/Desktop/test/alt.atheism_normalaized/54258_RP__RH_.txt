It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were 
inserted badly by later editors  As for the four gospels being in harmony

MAT 2675  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus  which  said unto him 
Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice And he went out and wept 
bitterly 
 
LUK 2260  And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest  And immediately 
while he yet spake the cock crew 
LUK 2261  And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter And  Peter remembered 
the word of the Lord how he had said unto him Before the cock crow thou 
shalt deny me thrice 
 
JOH 1338  Jesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake  
Verily 
 verily I say unto
