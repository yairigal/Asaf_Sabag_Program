FOR EXAMPLE, I WOULD CLAIM THAT THE RECENT ASSASSINATION OF FOUR
CATHOLIC CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THE IRA
WAS PROBABLY RELIGOUSLY MOTIVATED.

WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IS WHEN SOMEONE WRITES "THE KILLINGS IN N.I 
ARE NOT RELIGOUSLY MOTIVATED?"

|> NOW, IT'S POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT 
|> RELIGION *IN THE PAST* IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE VIOLENCE IN
|> THE PRESENT, BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS SO - AND I'M
|> NOT ENOUGH OF A HISTORIAN TO DEBATE IT. 

GIVEN THAT THE AVOWED AIM OF THE IRA IS TO TAKE NORTHERN IRELAND
INTO A COUNTRY THAT HAS A PARTICULAR CHURCH WRITTEN INTO ITS 
CONSTITUTION, AND WHICH HAS RESTRICTION ON CIVIL RIGHTS DICTATED
BY THAT CHURCH, I FAIL TO SEE WHY THE WORD "PAST" IS APPROPRIATE.


|> #|> #BUT TO CLAIM THAT "THE KILLINGS IN N.I ARE NOT RELIGOUSLY

|> #SORRY, FRANK, BUT WHAT I PUT IN QUOTES IS YOUR OWN WORDS FROM YOUR

YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAND US A BUNCH OF DOUBLE-TALK ABOUT WHAT
I WAS "SEEMINGLY" ATTACKING.   I *QUOTED* WHAT I WAS ATTACKING.

JON.
