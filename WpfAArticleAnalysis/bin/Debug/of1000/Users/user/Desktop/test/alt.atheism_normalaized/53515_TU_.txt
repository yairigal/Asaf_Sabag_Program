IT'S NOT REALLY THEIR _DECISION_ TO BE TRIED. THE RULINGS _DO_ HAVE
LEGAL CONSEQUENCES, BUT ONLY IN ISLAMIC LAW AND NOT IN UK LAW (THIS
SHOULD BE OBVIOUS). ENFORCING A JUDGMENT IS DISTINCT FROM THE MAKING
OF A JUDGMENT. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE WORLD COURT. THIS
IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBUNAL WHOSE JUDGMENTS OFTEN HAVE NO
PHYSICAL OR ECONOMIC EFFECT BUT WHICH _ARE_ IMPORTANT DESPITE THE FACT
THAT THEIR JUDGMENTS CANNOT BE ENFORCED

OF COURSE, HAVE YOU READ ANY OF THIS THREAD BEFORE THIS POST?

OF COURSE, IT IS A SORT OF ANARCHISM. ANARCHISM IS EXPLICITLY AGAINST
ISLAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WELL REASONED RESPONSE, BUT IT IS BESIDE THE
POINTS I'VE BEEN MAKING IN THIS THREAD.
