: THE SOCIAL PRESSURE IS INDEED A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THE MAJORITY
: OF PASSIVE CHRISTIANS IN OUR WORLD TODAY. IN THE CASE OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY
: THE PROMISE OF A HEAVENLY AFTERLIFE, INDEPENDENT OF YOUR SOCIAL STATUS,
: WAS ALSO A VERY PROMISING GIFT (REASON SLAVES AND NON-ROMANS ACCEPTED
: THE RELIGION VERY RAPIDLY).

IF THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL PROPOSITION, YOU SHOULD SAY SO, IF IT'S
FACT, YOU SHOULD CITE YOUR SOURCES. IF ALL THIS IS THE AMATEUR
SOCIOLOGIST SUB-BRANCH OF A.A HOWEVER, IT WOULD SUFFICE TO ALERT THE
UNWARY THAT YOU ARE JUST SCREWING AROUND ...
