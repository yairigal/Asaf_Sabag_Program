This is exactly the type of thing I was talking about before A creationist 
appears on to makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of 
which heshe is completely ignorant is taken to task and finally replies 
with a subtle insult actually two insults 
 
Just to make sure I am being fair lets check a few details Jack you dont 
know anything about abiogenesis do you this is no sin I know next to 
nothing about it either I mean anything other than this 1050  
probability thing which you got wrong in the first post 
 
The speculation involved is really your own isnt it How much biology 
do you know even apart from abiogenesis Any classes past high school 
Read Chris Colbys FAQ How much paleontology geology etc do you know 
Or are you speculating that its all speculative Do you have any basis 
upon which to imply that to keep an open mind one must allow that 
the earth universe and all the creatures in it could have been created 
10000 years ago None of this is intended as a flame To say that 
you dont know a subject is not the same as calling you an idiot I 
dont know much about these areas but then I am not the one 
calling into question all of mainstream science In other words where 
do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that 
all of physics chemistry etc are also speculative in some sense 
 
You may have in fact not been implying that the rejection of creationism 
is a sign of closemindedness or that the theory of evolution is especially 
speculative in which case I have merely misinterpreted 
you In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear
