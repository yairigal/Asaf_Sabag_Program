THE FLAT-EARTHERS STATE THAT "THE EARTH IS FLAT" IS A FACT. I DON'T ACCEPT
THIS, I THINK IT'S AN UNPROVEN OPINION, AND I THINK THE ROUND-EARTHERS ARE
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER EVIDENCE THAN THE FLAT-EARTHERS DO.

ALTHOUGH I CAN'T PROVE THAT A GOD DOESN'T EXIST, THE ARGUMENTS USED TO
SUPPORT A GOD'S EXISTENCE ARE WEAK AND OFTEN SELF-CONTRADICTORY, AND I'M NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE IN A GOD UNLESS SOMEONE COMES OVER TO ME AND GIVES ME A
REASON TO BELIEVE IN A GOD THAT I ABSOLUTELY CAN'T IGNORE.

A WHILE AGO, I READ AN INTERESTING BOOK BY A FELLOW CALLED VON DAENICKEN,
IN WHICH HE PROVED SOME OF THE WILDEST THINGS, AND ON THE LAST PAGE, HE
WROTE SOMETHING LIKE "CAN YOU PROVE IT ISN'T SO?" I CERTAINLY CAN'T, BUT
I'M NOT GOING TO BELIEVE HIM, BECAUSE HE BASED HIS "PROOF" ON SOME REALLY
QUESTIONABLE STUFF, SUCH AS OLD MYTHS (HE CALLED IT "CIRCUMSTANCIAL
EVIDENCE" :] ).

SO FAR, ATHEISM HASN'T MADE ME KILL ANYONE, AND I'M REGARDED AS QUITE AN
AGREEABLE FELLOW, REALLY. :)
