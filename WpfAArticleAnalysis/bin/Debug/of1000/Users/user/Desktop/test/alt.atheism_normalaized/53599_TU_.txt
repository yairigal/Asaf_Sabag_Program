YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY IT BOTHERS ME THAT THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE
MAIMED OR KILLED BY BOMBING AT THE END OF WW2, WHEN IT WAS FAR FROM CLEAR
THAT SUCH BOMBING WAS NECESSARY?

NO, JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE OIL.  OR THE ONES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY MIGHT MAKE
A SUCCESS OF COMMUNISM.

I DON'T SEE THAT GETTING UN FORCES TO EAST TIMOR IS ANY HARDER THAN GETTING
THEM TO IRAQ.

FINE.  WRITE TO YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.  CHINA'S STATUS AS
"MOST FAVOURED NATION" COMES UP FOR RENEWAL IN JUNE.  POINT OUT THAT THE US
SHOULDN'T BE OFFERING FAVOURABLE TRADING TERMS TO SUCH A DESPICABLE REGIME.

I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN.  CLINTON'S KEENER ON TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST
EUROPE.

THE SAME TIRED OLD MISUNDERSTANDING.  MORAL RELATIVISM MEANS THAT THERE IS NO
*OBJECTIVE* STANDARD OF MORALITY.  IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T JUDGE OTHER
PEOPLE'S MORALS.  CHRIST ON A BIKE, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE TRIED TO HAMMER

OBVIOUSLY NOT, AS I AM AN ATHEIST.  I DON'T THINK YOU'D GET ON WITH JESUS,
THOUGH; HE WAS A LONG-HAIRED LUNATIC PEACE-NIK, WAS HE NOT?
