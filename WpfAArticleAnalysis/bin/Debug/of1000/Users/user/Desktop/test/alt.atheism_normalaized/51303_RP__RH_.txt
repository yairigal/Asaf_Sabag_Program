But of course YOUR version of YOUR position has been included in the 
Charley Challenges so your claim above is a flatout lie  Further 
only last week you claimed that you might not answer the Challenges 
because you were turned off by included text  So which is it do 
you want your context included in my articles or not  Come to think 
of it this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next 
Challenges post 
 
By the way Ive kept every bloody thing that youve written related 
to this thread and will be only too pleased to repost any of it to 
back my position  You seem to have forgotten that you leave an 
electronic paper trail on the net

Now now lets not change the subject  Wouldnt it be best to finish 
up the thread in question before you begin new ones
