 Heres the main problem The scenario you outline is reasonably  
consistent but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does 
not support it but indicates something far different The Earth by 
latest estimates is about 46 billion years old and has had life for 
about 35 billion of those years Humans have only been around for at 
most about 200000 years But the fossil evidence inidcates that life 
has been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long before 
there were people Yes there are fossils that show signs of disease 
mostly bone disorders of course but there are some Heck not just 
fossil evidence but what weve been able to glean from genetic study shows 
that disease has been around for a long long time If human sin was what 
brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then 
how could it exist before humans

 Uh I know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about 
biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this There 
is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off 
in perfect condition It seems to adapt to its envionment in a 
collective sense Im really curious as to what you mean by the 
degeneration of the genetic code
