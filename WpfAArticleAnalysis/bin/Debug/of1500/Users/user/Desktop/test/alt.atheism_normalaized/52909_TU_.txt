ABSTRACT CONCEPT IS TREATED AS A CONCRETE THING.

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF

THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ALWAYS ON THE PERSON MAKING AN ASSERTION OR
PROPOSITION.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF, A SPECIAL CASE OF ARGUMENTUM AD
IGNORANTIUM, IS THE FALLACY OF PUTTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE PERSON WHO
DENIES OR QUESTIONS THE ASSERTION BEING MADE.  THE SOURCE OF THE FALLACY IS
THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMETHING IS TRUE UNLESS PROVEN OTHERWISE.

STRAW MAN

THE STRAW MAN FALLACY IS TO MISREPRESENT SOMEONE ELSE'S POSITION SO THAT IT
CAN BE ATTACKED MORE EASILY, THEN TO KNOCK DOWN THAT MISREPRESENTED POSITION,
THEN TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ORIGINAL POSITION HAS BEEN DEMOLISHED.  IT IS A
FALLACY BECAUSE IT FAILS TO DEAL WITH THE ACTUAL ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN
MADE.

THE EXTENDED ANALOGY

THE FALLACY OF THE EXTENDED ANALOGY OFTEN OCCURS WHEN SOME SUGGESTED GENERAL
RULE IS BEING ARGUED OVER.  THE FALLACY IS TO ASSUME THAT MENTIONING TWO 
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, IN AN ARGUMENT ABOUT A GENERAL RULE, CONSTITUTES A 
CLAIM THAT THOSE SITUATIONS ARE ANALOGOUS TO EACH OTHER.

THIS FALLACY IS BEST EXPLAINED USING A REAL EXAMPLE FROM A DEBATE ABOUT 
ANTI-CRYPTOGRAPHY LEGISLATION:

"I BELIEVE IT IS ALWAYS WRONG TO OPPOSE THE LAW BY BREAKING IT."

"SUCH A POSITION IS ODIOUS: IT IMPLIES THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED
 MARTIN LUTHER KING."

"ARE YOU SAYING THAT CRYPTOGRAPHY LEGISLATION IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE
 STRUGGLE FOR BLACK LIBERATION?  HOW DARE YOU!"

TU QUOQUE

THIS IS THE FAMOUS "YOU TOO" FALLACY.  IT OCCURS WHEN AN ACTION IS ARGUED TO
BE ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTY HAS PERFORMED IT.  FOR INSTANCE:

"YOU'RE JUST BEING RANDOMLY ABUSIVE."
"SO?  YOU'VE BEEN ABUSIVE TOO."
