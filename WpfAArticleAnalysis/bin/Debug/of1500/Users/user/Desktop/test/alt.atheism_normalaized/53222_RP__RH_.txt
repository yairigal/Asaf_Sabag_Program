Humans have gone somewhat beyond what exactly    In one thread 
youre telling us that natural morality is what animals do to 
survive and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient 
being can definitely say what is right and what is wrong   So 
what does this omniscient being use for a criterion   The long 
term survival of the human species or what 
 
How does omniscient map into definitely being able to assign 
right and wrong to actions

Well your original premises have a habit of changing over time 
so perhaps youd like to review it for us and tell us what the 
difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign right 
and wrong to actions and telling us the result is

Im talking about the morality introduced by you which was going to 
be implemented by this omniscient being that can definitely assign 
right and wrong to actions 
 
You tell us what type of morality that is
