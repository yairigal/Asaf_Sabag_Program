Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame  If society 
accepts such a system then each member of society is to blame when 
an innocent person gets executed  Those that are not in favor should 
work to convince others 
 
And most members of our society have accepted the blametheyve considered 
the risk to be acceptable  Similarly every person who drives must accept 
the blame for fatal traffic accidents  This is something that is surely 
going to happen when so many people are driving  It is all a question of 
what risk is acceptable  It is much more likely that an innocent person 
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed
