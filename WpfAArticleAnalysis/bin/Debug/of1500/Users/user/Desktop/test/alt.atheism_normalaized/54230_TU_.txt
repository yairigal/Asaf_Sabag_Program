WELL, I WAS RAISED AS AN ATHIEST, AND EVENTUALLY TOOK ON A THEISTIC
VIEW. HOWEVER I TRY TO BE A RATIONALIST AS WELL AS A THEIST. ANYHOW,
I WILL TRY TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS, JUST TO 
CONTRIBUTE SOME DATAPOINTS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

RELIGION _CAN_ BE A CRUTCH. BEFORE GOING MUCH FURTHER ON THAT THREAD,
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE VERIETY OF WORLD
RELIGIONS OUT THERE, THOUGH. THERE ARE ATHIESTIC RELIGIONS AS WELL AS
THEISTIC RELIGIONS. THERE ARE RELIGIONS THAT CLAIM KNOWLEDGE ABOUT
SUCH THINGS AS AN AFTERLIFE, AND THERE ARE RELIGIONS THAT MAKE NO SUCH
CLAIMS. 

MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE TALK, BUT ALL THAT MEANS IS THAT
TALK IS CHEAP. WHEN SOMEONE GIVES ME SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT AN
AFTERLIFE, THEN I'LL START BELIEVING IN ONE. IN THE MEAN WHILE, MY
RELIGION DEALS WITH WHAT WE KNOW EXISTS, THAT IS LIFE HERE AND NOW.

>RELIGION ALSO DESCRIBES THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE UNIVERSE (THINGS
>SCIENCE HAS NOT YET DESCRIBED) AND IT ALSO GIVES PEOPLE A FEELING OF
>SECURITY... THAT IF THEY JUST DO THIS ONE THING AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OK.

AGAIN, SOME RELIGIONS DO, AND OTHERS DO NOT. SOME RELIGIONS TEACH PEOPLE
THAT LIFE IS CHAOTIC AND TO ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS.

>THAT THEY ARE BEING WATCHED OVER BY A HIGHER POWER AND ITS MINIONS.  THIS
>HAS A VERY HIGH PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRACTION FOR QUITE A FEW PEOPLE AND THESE
>PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH A FEW DISCREPANCIES AND HOLES IN THEIR
>BELIEF SYSTEM FOR WHAT IT GAINS THEM.  THIS IS WHY I THINK IT'S KIND OF
>USELESS TO TRY TOO HARD TO CONVERT THEISTS TO ATHEISM.  THEY ARE HAPPY WITH
>THEIR FANTASY AND THEY FEEL THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY WITH IT TOO
>(THEY CAN'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER ACCEPT
>THE HARSH REALITY THAT THEY ARE RUNNING FROM).

I'LL TELL YOU THAT I MOVED FROM AN ATHIESTIC PERSPECTIVE TO A THEISTIC
ONE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT I OBSERVED PHENOMENON THAT WAS BETTER 
EXPLAINED FROM THE THEISTIC PERSPECTIVE, WHILE THE ATHIESTIC PERSPECTIVE
COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT. HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I'M WILLING TO
ACCEPT A LOT OF FOURTH HAND GOBBLY-GOOK THAT CONTRIDICTS MODERN SCIENCE
ALONG WITH MY THEISTIC PERSPECTIVE.
