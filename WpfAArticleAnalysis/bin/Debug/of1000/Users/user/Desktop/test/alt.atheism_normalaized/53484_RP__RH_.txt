When you look into the math of the different possible frames of reference 
you will find out that this time is not physically relevant

The relevant time for the falling object

There is NO singularity at the horizon  The appearance that there is one 
comes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesnt map properly 
physically in this geometry rather analogous to the singularity at 
the North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitude 
lines  Such singular behavior as the earlier post suggested infinite 
time to reach the horizon is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choice 
of coordinates  As Paul says in the objects frame of reference 
it WILL hit the horizon in finite time and then plunge to the singularity 
that IS a real singularity in a short for small holes further finite  
amount of time 
 
Not only that but to an OUTSIDE observer an object that falls into a black 
hole disappears in a finite time also in spite of the relativistic slow 
down that intuition suggests  This is because any light emitted by the 
object as it falls or is shone onto it by a separate flashlight consists 
of individual FINITE quanta and only a finite number of these can reach 
the object before it plunges through the horizon  These will be succesively 
more redshifted true but only a finite number of them will hit the object 
and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they 
too are inside the horizon and thus cannot come out 
 
This reddening dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast as the object  
approaches the horizon when you do the math 
 
As Paul says this is discussed in Misner Thorne and Wheelers book  
Gravity where they talk about the appropriatness sp of the term black  
hole and the inappropriatness sp of an older term frozen star which  
was used earlier in this century before all the implications of blackhole  
theory were understood  Do not let the math deter you from looking at this  
book its got a lot of good prose discussions of this material in between  
the equations that is VERY good reading IMHO 
 
Of course its all just THEORY
