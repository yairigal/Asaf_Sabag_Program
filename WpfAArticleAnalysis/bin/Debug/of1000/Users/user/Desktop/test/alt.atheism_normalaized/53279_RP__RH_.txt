  Precisely my position   
 
  As a newbie I tried the pointbypoint approach to debate with 
  these types  It wasted both my time and my lifespan  Ignoring 
  them is not an option since they dont go away and doing so 
  would leave one with large stretches of complete anonymity in this 
  group 
 
  Whats left  Healthy flaming  Im sure on occassion Ive 
  appeared to be little more than a caustic boob to some of the 
  Bobby types  But why waste breath arguing with someone whose most 
  rational though process involves his excretory system 
 
  And I stand by my record of recognizing these people long before 
  most of the rest of the group  So lets see what this Timmons 
  character has in store for us
