WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE MATH OF THE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE FRAMES OF REFERENCE
YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THIS "TIME" IS NOT PHYSICALLY RELEVANT...

        ^^^ "CENTER OF THE HOLE" WHERE THE EVIL SINGULARITY LURKS

THERE IS NO SINGULARITY AT THE HORIZON.  THE APPEARANCE THAT THERE IS ONE
COMES FROM ATTEMPTING TO USE A COORDINATE SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MAP PROPERLY
(PHYSICALLY) IN THIS GEOMETRY, RATHER ANALOGOUS TO THE "SINGULARITY" AT
THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES OF THE EARTH WHEN USING LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
LINES.  SUCH "SINGULAR" BEHAVIOR AS THE EARLIER POST SUGGESTED (INFINITE
TIME TO REACH THE HORIZON) IS A MATHEMATICAL ARTIFACT OF THE WRONG CHOICE
OF COORDINATES.  AS PAUL SAYS, IN THE OBJECT'S FRAME OF REFERENCE,
IT WILL HIT THE HORIZON IN FINITE TIME, AND THEN PLUNGE TO THE SINGULARITY
(THAT IS A "REAL" SINGULARITY) IN A (SHORT, FOR "SMALL" HOLES) FURTHER FINITE 
AMOUNT OF TIME.

NOT ONLY THAT, BUT TO AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER, AN OBJECT THAT FALLS INTO A BLACK
HOLE DISAPPEARS IN A FINITE TIME ALSO, IN SPITE OF THE RELATIVISTIC "SLOW-
DOWN" THAT INTUITION SUGGESTS.  THIS IS BECAUSE ANY LIGHT EMITTED BY THE
OBJECT AS IT FALLS (OR IS SHONE ONTO IT BY A SEPARATE "FLASHLIGHT") CONSISTS
OF INDIVIDUAL, FINITE QUANTA, AND ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF THESE CAN REACH
THE OBJECT BEFORE IT PLUNGES THROUGH THE HORIZON.  THESE WILL BE SUCCESIVELY
MORE RED-SHIFTED, TRUE, BUT ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF THEM WILL HIT THE OBJECT,
AND FOLLOWING ONES WILL BE TOO LATE TO INTERACT WITH THE OBJECT UNTIL THEY,
TOO, ARE INSIDE THE HORIZON (AND THUS CANNOT COME OUT).

THIS REDDENING, DIMMING AND DISAPPEARANCE IS EXPONENTIALLY FAST, AS THE OBJECT 
APPROACHES THE HORIZON, WHEN YOU DO THE MATH.

AS PAUL SAYS, THIS IS DISCUSSED IN MISNER, THORNE, AND WHEELER'S BOOK 
"GRAVITY" WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT THE APPROPRIATNESS (SP?) OF THE TERM "BLACK 
HOLE" AND THE INAPPROPRIATNESS (SP?) OF AN OLDER TERM: "FROZEN STAR", WHICH 
WAS USED EARLIER IN THIS CENTURY BEFORE ALL THE IMPLICATIONS OF BLACK-HOLE 
THEORY WERE UNDERSTOOD.  DO NOT LET THE MATH DETER YOU FROM LOOKING AT THIS 
BOOK; IT'S GOT A LOT OF GOOD PROSE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS MATERIAL, IN BETWEEN 
THE EQUATIONS, THAT IS VERY GOOD READING, IMHO.

OF COURSE, IT'S ALL JUST THEORY... :-)
