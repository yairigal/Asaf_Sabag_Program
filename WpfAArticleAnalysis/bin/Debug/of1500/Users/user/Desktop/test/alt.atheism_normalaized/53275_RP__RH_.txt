Hi Adda 
 
Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain 
time  the time when the author wrote it  Unfortunately like all works 
from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies

There are parts of books scraps really that date from around the 
mid second century AD 130+  There are some complete books letters 
etc from the middle third century  The first complete collection of 
the New Testament dates from the early 4th century AD 325  Throughout 
this period are writings of various early church fathersleaders who 
quoted various scriptures in their writings

If you mean that someone discovered thousands of Bibles which were all 
perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st centuryNo 
 
If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the 
dates given above but not letter perfect and that the most probable 
text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest 
original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime 
shortly after AD 50 then yes

From the original authors  We call them Matthew Mark Luke John Peter 
Paul James and one other not identified
