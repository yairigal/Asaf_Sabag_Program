RIGHTO, DAN, TRY THIS ONE WITH YOUR CORNFLAKES...

THE BOOK SAYS THAT MUHAMMAD WAS EITHER A LIAR, OR HE WAS CRAZY ( A 
MODERN DAY MAD MAHDI) OR HE WAS ACTUALLY WHO HE SAID HE WAS.
SOME REASONS WHY HE WOULDN'T BE A LIAR ARE AS FOLLOWS.  WHO WOULD 
DIE FOR A LIE?  WOULDN'T PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR?  PEOPLE 
GATHERED AROUND HIM AND KEPT DOING IT, MANY GATHERED FROM HEARING OR SEEING 
HOW HIS SON-IN-LAW MADE THE SUN STAND STILL.  CALL ME A FOOL, BUT I BELIEVE 
HE DID MAKE THE SUN STAND STILL.  
NIETHER WAS HE A LUNATIC.  WOULD MORE THAN AN ENTIRE NATION BE DRAWN 
TO SOMEONE WHO WAS CRAZY.  VERY DOUBTFUL, IN FACT REDICULOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE 
ANYONE WHO IS DRAWN TO THE MAD MAHDI IS OBVIOUSLY A FOOL, LOGICAL PEOPLE SEE 
THIS RIGHT AWAY.
THEREFORE SINCE HE WASN'T A LIAR OR A LUNATIC, HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE 
REAL THING.
