PHILIP K. DICK

PHILIP K. DICK DICK WROTE MANY PHILOSOPHICAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING SHORT 
STORIES AND NOVELS.  HIS STORIES ARE BIZARRE AT TIMES, BUT VERY APPROACHABLE.
HE WROTE MAINLY SF, BUT HE WROTE ABOUT PEOPLE, TRUTH AND RELIGION RATHER THAN
TECHNOLOGY.  ALTHOUGH HE OFTEN BELIEVED THAT HE HAD MET SOME SORT OF GOD, HE
REMAINED SCEPTICAL.  AMONGST HIS NOVELS, THE FOLLOWING ARE OF SOME RELEVANCE:

"GALACTIC POT-HEALER"
A FALLIBLE ALIEN DEITY SUMMONS A GROUP OF EARTH CRAFTSMEN AND WOMEN TO A
REMOTE PLANET TO RAISE A GIANT CATHEDRAL
