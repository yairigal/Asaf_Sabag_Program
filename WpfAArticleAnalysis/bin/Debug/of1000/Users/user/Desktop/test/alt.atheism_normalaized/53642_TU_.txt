ABSTRACT "ARGUMENT".   NORTHERN IRISH PROTESTANTS SAY
#|> #"WE DON'T WANT TO BE ABSORBED INTO AM OFFICIALLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY."
#|> #
#|> #NOW WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?   ARE WE SUPPOSED TO REPLY "NO,
#|> #THAT'S ONLY WHAT YOU THINK YOU DON'T WANT.   MR O'DWYER ASSURES US
#|> #THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY YOU WANT, YOU REALLY WANT SOMETHING 
#|> #ELSE?"
#|> 
#|> YOU THINK THE UNIONISTS WOULDN'T MIND BEING ABSORBED INTO A NON-CATHOLIC 
#|> COUNTRY (OTHER THAN THE UK OF COURSE)?   IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO LOSE
#|> A MIND.   MAYBE THE WORD "COUNTRY" IS THERE FOR MORE THAN JUST KICKS.
#|> I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE UNIONISTS ARE IN IT FOR GOD - I THINK
#|> THEY WISH TO MAINTAIN THEIR POSITION OF PRIVILEGE.
#
#I'M STILL LISTENING TO WHAT THEY SAY, AND YOU ARE STILL TELLING US 
#YOUR VERSION OF WHAT THEY THINK.   YOU READ MINDS, AND I DON'T.

YOU'VE SPECULATED ON MY MOTIVES OFTEN ENOUGH, AND YOU DON'T TAKE
MY STATEMENTS OF MY OWN BELIEFS AT FACE VALUE - THEREFORE YOUR CLAIM 
NOT TO READ MINDS HAS NO CREDIBILITY WITH ME, SORRY.   I ALSO NOTE THAT 
YOU FAIL TO ANSWER MY QUESTION.  IT JUST LOOKS TO ME VERY MUCH LIKE
YOU HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND - ESPECIALLY AS YOU ARE INDEED IGNORING WHAT 
MOST PROTESTANTS SAY - WHICH IS @STOP THE KILLING".  THE PEOPLE YOU
REFER TO ARE PROPERLY DESCRIBED AS UNIONISTS, NOT PROTESTANTS.
#
#AS FOR THEIR POSITION OF PRIVILEGE, WHAT IS THAT IF NOT RELIGION-
#BASED?

IT IS BASED ON POLITICS, BIGOTRY, AND HEARTLESS EXTREMISM.  NONE OF THESE
THINGS ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH RELIGION, THOUGH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME
OVERLAP.
