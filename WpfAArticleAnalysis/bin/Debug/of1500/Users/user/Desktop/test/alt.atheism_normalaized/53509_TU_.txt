LUCKY FOR THEM THAT THE BABY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBVIOUS DEFORMITIES!  I COULD
JUST SEE IT NOW: MARY GETS PREGNANT OUT OF WEDLOCK SO TO SAVE FACE SHE AND
JOSEPH SAY THAT IT WAS GOD THAT GOT HER PREGNANT AND THEN THE BABY TURNS
OUT TO BE DEFORMED, OR EVEN WORSE, STILLBORN!  THEY'D HAVE A LOT OF
EXPLAINING TO DO.... :-)
