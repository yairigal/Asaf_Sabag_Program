Well Ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this is 
objectively a murder  However who is at blame is another question 
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions 
realizing the risksis to blame

Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing 
any raondom activity  Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally 
from the rest of society because of this

And I argue that our law system is a similar risk  Perhaps an innocent 
person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this  In fact 
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment 
of innocents

But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals 
on the road  Again the blame is on society

Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case  The state can only do 
so much to prevent false witnesses
