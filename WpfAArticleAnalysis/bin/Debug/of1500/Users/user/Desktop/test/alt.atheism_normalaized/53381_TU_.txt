HMM, USENET GOT IT'S COLLECTIVE HOOKS INTO ME AROUND 1987 OR SO RIGHT AFTER I
SWITCHED TO ENGINEERING.  I'D SAY I STARTED READING ALT.ATHEISM AROUND 1988-89.
I'VE PROBABLY NOT POSTED MORE THAN 50 MESSAGES IN THE TIME SINCE THEN THOUGH.
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CAN FIND THE TIME TO WRITE SO MUCH.  I
CAN BARELY KEEP UP AS IT IS.
