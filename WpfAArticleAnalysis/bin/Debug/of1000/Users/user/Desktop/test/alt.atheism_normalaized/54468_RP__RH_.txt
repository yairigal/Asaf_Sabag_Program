I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue 
Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination 
grasp at straws or do other strange things when faced with extreme 
suffering not to mention physiological problems which may lead to 
diminished mental capacity 
 
At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to 
authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of 
obituary for the late atheist Dr Albert Sabin In an old interview 
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time 
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness 
He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a 
respirator As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years 
After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination Dont say 
it couldnt happen to you or that it hasnt happened to others even if 
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this 
People are different I admire Dr Sabin for admitting his human weakness 
in that instance I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness 
 
Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may 
well be untrue In any case they are not evidence for anything besides 
the power of early indoctrination and human frailty
