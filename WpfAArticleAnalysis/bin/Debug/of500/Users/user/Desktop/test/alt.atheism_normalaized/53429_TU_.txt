>STATE WHY FAITH AND DOGMA ARE DANGEROUS.  

FAITH AND DOGMA ARE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CAUSE PEOPLE TO ACT ON
FAITH ALONE, WHICH BY ITS NATURE IS WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION.  THAT
IS WHAT I MEAN BY THE WORD ``FAITH'': BELIEF WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION, OR
BELIEF WITH ARBITRARY JUSTIFICATION, OR WITH EMOTIONAL (IRRATIONAL)
JUSTIFICATION.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT GOD EXISTS, THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY BELIEVE GOD EXISTS, THEY CAN JUST FEEL IT, THAT'S FAITH.

DOGMA IS BAD BECAUSE IT PRECLUDES POSITIVE CHANGE IN BELIEF BASED
ON NEW INFORMATION, OR INCREASED MENTAL FACULTY.

FAITH AND DOGMA ARE IRRATIONAL.  THE FAITH AND DOGMA PART OF ANY RELIGION
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IRRATIONALITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS.  I CLAIM THAT
FAITH AND DOGMA ARE THE QUINTESSENTIAL PART OF ANY RELIGION.  IF THAT
MAKES (THE MUCH OVERUSED IN THIS CONTEXT) BUDDISM A PHILOSOPHY RATHER
THAN A RELIGION, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.  SCIENCE IS NOT A RELIGION,
BECAUSE THERE IS NO FAITH NOR DOGMA.

HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT PHILOSOPHERS TEND TO BE ATHEISTS?  IF A PHILOSOPHER
IS NOT AN ATHEIST, S/HE TENDS TO BE CALLED A THEOLOGIAN.

A CHRISTIAN TENDS TO CONSIDER CHRISTIANITY SACRED.  CHRISTIANITY IS
A SPECIAL SET OF BELIEFS, SANCTIONED BY GOD HIMSELF, AND THEREFORE,
TO CONCEIVE OF CHANGING THOSE BELIEFS IS TO QUESTION THE EXISTENCE
OF THAT BEING WHO MAKES NO MISTAKES.  FAITH COMES INTO PLAY.  DOGMA
COMES INTO PLAY.  ``THE LORD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS'' IS AN EXAMPLE
OF FAITH BEING USED TO RECONCILE EVIDENCE THAT THE BELIEFS ARE FLAWED.
SURE, INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT ``GOD SAID'' ARE CHANGED TO SATISFY THE
NEEDS OF SOCIETY, BUT WHEN GOD SAYS SOMETHING, THAT'S IT.  IT WAS SAID,
AND THAT'S THAT.  SINCE GOD SAID IT, IT IS UNFLAWED, EVEN IF THE
INTERPRETATIONS ARE FLAWED.

SCIENCE, (AS WOULD BE PRACTICED BY ATHEISTS) IN CONTRAST, HAS A
BUILT IN DEFENCE AGAINST FAITH AND DOGMA.
A SCIENTIST HOLDS SACRED THE IDEA THAT BELIEFS SHOULD CHANGE
