Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy  Just what organization did he  
belong to Does it have a name

Logic alert  artificial trifercation  The are many other possible explainations  Could have been 
that he never existed  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  
impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to mind

Logic alert   argument from incredulity  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesnt 
mean that it isnt true  Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself site 
He has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die 
By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  
he believes  As far as healing goes  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not 
consistent between the different gospels  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  
that faith healers can pull off today  Seems to me that the early gospels werent that compeling 
so the stories got bigger to appeal better
