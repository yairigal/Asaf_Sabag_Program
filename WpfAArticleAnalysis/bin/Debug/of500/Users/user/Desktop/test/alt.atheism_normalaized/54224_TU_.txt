ANDREW,

THE MYTH TO WHICH I REFER IS THE CONVOLUTED COUNTERFEIT ATHIESTS HAVE
CREATED TO MAKE RELIGION APPEAR ABSURD. RATHER THAN APPROACH RELIGION
(INCLUDING CHRISTAINITY) IN A RATIONAL MANNER AND DEBATING ITS CLAIMS
-AS THE ARE STATED-, ATHEISTS CONCOCT OUTRAGEOUS PARODIES AND THEN
HOLD THE RELIGIOUS ACCOUNTABLE FOR BELIEFS THEY DON'T HAVE. WHAT IS
MORE ACCURATELY OXYMORIC IS THE A TERM LIKE, REASONABLE ATHEIST.

HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OF WHAT I SAID ABOVE. READ THE POST AGAIN, I
SAID, "ACOORDING TO ...", WHICH MEANS I AM REFERRING TO CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE (AS I UNDERSTAND IT), IF I AM SPEAKING FOR MYSELF YOU'LL KNOW
IT. MY PURPOSE IN POSTING WAS TO PRESENT A BASIC OVERVIEW OF CHRISTAIN
DOCTRINES SINCE IT SEEMED GERMANE.

: IF THE BIBLE SAYS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS, THAT'S CLEARLY REASON

AGAIN I AM PARAPHRASING CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE WHICH IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS
POINT, YOUR DISPUTE IS NOT WITH ME ...

: 1) NO, THEY DON'T HAVE TO IGNORE THE BIBLE.  THE BIBLE IS FAR
: FROM UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED.  THE BIBLE IS NOT A PROOF OF GOD;
: IT IS ONLY A PROOF THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE
: WAS A GOD.  (OR DOES IT PROVE EVEN THAT?  THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
