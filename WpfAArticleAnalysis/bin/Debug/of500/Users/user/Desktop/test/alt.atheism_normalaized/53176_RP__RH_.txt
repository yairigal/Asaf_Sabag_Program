Issued by Khomeini it shouldnt be relevant to anyone But issued 
by an honest and learned scholar of Islam it would be relevant to 
any muslim as it would be contrary to Islamic law which all muslims 
are required to respect 
 
>  Who is it that decides whether Rushdies behavior is excusable  
 
Anyone sufficiently well versed in Islamic law and capable of reasoning 
if you are talking about a weak sense of excuse It depends on what  
sense of excuse you have in mind 
 
 
> And who cares if you think it is inexcusable 
 
Only someone who thinks my opinion is important obviously 
Obviously you dont care nor do I care that you dont care
