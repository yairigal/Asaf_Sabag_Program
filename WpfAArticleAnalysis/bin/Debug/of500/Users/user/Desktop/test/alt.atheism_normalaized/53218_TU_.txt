THAT'S RIGHT.  HUMANS HAVE GONE SOMEWHAT BEYOND THIS THOUGH.  PERHAPS
OUR GOAL IS ONE OF SELF-ACTUALIZATION.

>BUT SUPPOSE THAT YOUR OMNISCIENT BEING TOLD YOU THAT THE LONG

NOW YOU ARE LETTING AN OMNISCIENT BEING GIVE INFORMATION TO ME.  THIS
WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL PREMISE.

>DOES THAT MAKE IT MORAL TO DO SO?

WHICH TYPE OF MORALITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  IN A NATURAL SENSE, IT
IS NOT AT ALL IMMORAL TO HARM ANOTHER SPECIES (AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR OWN, I GUESS).
