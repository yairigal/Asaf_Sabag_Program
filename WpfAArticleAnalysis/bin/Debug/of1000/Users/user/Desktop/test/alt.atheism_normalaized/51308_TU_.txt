I'M NOT SAYING THIS AT ALL - IT REQUIRES NO FAITH ON MY PART TO
SAY THE CAR DRIVES BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT DRIVE - I'VE DONE MORE
THAN AT IN FACT - I'VE ACTUALLY DRIVEN IT. (NOW WHAT DOES REQUIRE
SOME FAITH IS THE BELIEF THAT MY SENSES GIVE AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION
OF WHAT'S OUT THERE....) BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE - PRO OR CON -
FOR THE EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD (SEE WHAT I HAVE TO
SAY BELOW ON THIS).

SORRY IF I REMAIN SKEPTICAL - I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ENTIRELY A
CONCLUSION. THAT YOU HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A GOD
IS CORRECT - NEITHER HAVE I. BUT LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE 
OF SOMETHING IS IN NO WAY EVIDENCE FOR THE NON-EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING 
(THE CREATIONIST HAVE A SIMILAR MODE OF ARGUMENTATION IN WHICH IF THEY 
DISPROVE EVOLUTION THE ESTABLISH CREATION). YOU (PERSONALLY) HAVE NEVER 
SEEN A NEUTRINO BEFORE, BUT THEY EXIST. THE "PINK UNICORN" ANALOGY BREAKS
DOWN AND IS RATHER NAIVE. I HAVE A SCIENTIFIC THEORY THAT EXPLAINS THE 
APPEARANCE OF ANIMAL LIFE - EVOLUTION. WHEN I DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT 
"PINK UNICORNS" DON'T EXIST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM, THIS CONCLUSION
HAS IT'S FOUNDATION IN OBSERVATION AND THEORY. A "PINK UNICORN", IF
IT DID EXIST, WOULD BE QUALITATIVELY SIMILAR TO OTHER KNOWN ENTITIES.
THAT IS TO SAY, SINCE THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE THAT ALL LIFE ON EARTH HAS
EVOLVED FROM "MORE PRIMITIVE" ANCESTORS THESE PINK UNICORNS WOULD SHARE 
A COMMON ANSCESTORY WITH HORSES AND ZEBRAS AND SUCH. GOD, HOWEVER,
HAS NO SUCH CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANYTHING (IMO). THERE IS NO PHYSICAL
FRAME WORK OF OBSERVATION TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM.

I DISAGREE WITH YOU PROFOUNDLY ON THIS. I HAVEN'T DEFINED GOD AS
EXISTENCE - IN FACT, I HAVEN'T DEFINED GOD. BUT THIS MIGHT BE
GETTING OFF THE SUBJECT - ALTHOUGH IF YOU THINK IT'S RELEVANT
WE CAN COME BACK TO IT.

YOU ARE USING WRONG CATEGORIES HERE - OR PERHAPS YOU MISUNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M MAKING NO ARGUMENT WHAT SO EVER AND OFFERING NO
DEFINITION SO THERE IS NO FALLACY. I'M NOT TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU OF
ANYTHING. *I* BELIEVE - AND THAT RESTS UPON FAITH. AND IT IS INAPPROPRIATE
TO APPLY THE CATEGORY OF LOGIC IN THIS REALM (UNLESS SOMEONE TELLS YOU
THAT THEY CAN LOGICALLY PROVE GOD OR THAT THEY HAVE "EVIDENCE" OR ...,
THEN THE USE OF LOGIC TO DISPROVE THEIR CLAIMS IF FINE AND NECESSARY).

BTW, AN INCOMPLETE ARGUMENT IS NOT A FALLACY - SOME THINGS ARE NOT
EVEN WRONG.

I DON'T FOLLOW YOU HERE. CERTAINLY ONE CAN MAKE OBSERVATIONS OF
THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. I STILL MAINTAIN THAT ONE
CANNOT USE OBSERVATION TO INFER THAT "GOD DOES NOT EXIST". SUCH
A POSITIVE ASSERTION REQUIRES A LEAP.

ONCE AGAIN YOU SEEM TO COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTAND ME. I HAVE NO
EVIDENCE THAT "'GOD IS' IS MEANINGFUL" AT ANY LEVEL. MAYBE SUCH
A RESPONSE AS YOU GAVE JUST COMES NATURALLY
