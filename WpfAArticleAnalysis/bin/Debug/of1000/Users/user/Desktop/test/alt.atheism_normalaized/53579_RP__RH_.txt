 The same works for the horrors of history  To claim that Christianity 
 had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the 
 awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute  What it seems you 
 are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never 
 the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that 
 religion has had no evil impacts on history  That is absurd

Until this paragraph I would willingly amend my earlier statements 
since your points are well made and generally accurate This last 
part though slips into hyperbole Since Ive discussed my objections to 
such generalizations before I really dont feel I need to do it 
again If you havent seen those posts ask Maddi she saves 
everything I write
