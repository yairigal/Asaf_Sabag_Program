ABSTRACTION. ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THAT
CAN WE PROGRESS TO DEBATING WHETHER THIS MORALITY IS ABSOLUTE OR NOT.

THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CLAIMS THAT MORALITY IS A COMPONENT OF REALITY, BUT
THEN AGAIN, THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF CLAIMS MADE BY DIFFERENT FOLK OVER
THE CENTURIES. CLAIMS, WITHOUT FACT TO BACK THEM UP ARE ULTIMATLY VERY
HOLLOW THINGS.

SO, HAVING SAID THAT, I WOULD ASK YOU TO BEGIN BY DEMONSTRATING THAT MORALITY
IS OTHER THAN JUST AN ABSTRACTION. CARE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE?
