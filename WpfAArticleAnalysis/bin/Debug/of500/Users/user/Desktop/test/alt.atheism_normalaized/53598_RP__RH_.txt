A world creator god does the moment it creates the world And to sayi 
that you cant recall *anyone* is even below your usual standard of 
aarguing 
  
My argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions namely god 
is perfect god is allknowing god sets the rules The rules dont 
work for whatever reason Because of its omniscience the god has 
known it In advance

It is not a question of grammar it is a question of modelling Has been 
discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group 
When A is contradictorily defined A does not point to an instance in 
reality Unless there is more information in the definition of A that 
allows me to find it somehow However when the contradictory attribute 
is said to be essential ie has not got that attribute => not the A I 
am looking for I can conclude that A does not exist

I take 2 and dismiss the rest because of the unnecessary complexity 
the other evidence causes
