This is still contradictory It reduces to 
 
  1 Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug 
 
  2 this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for 
       bug meaning that it doesnt lend more weight to one than to the 
       other 
 
  3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence 
       can exist for bug 
 
But 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 When you say paraphrased 
in 2 that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you 
mean is that its no *more* evidence for benefactor than it is for bug 
 
Yes thats what I mean 
 
In 3 however youve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor 
so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than 
relative evidence for benefactor wrt bug 
 
Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other  I 
think this is just a communications problem   What I am trying to say 
in my clumsy way is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates 
to theism making predictions prayer your Rapture example I dont 
buy your use of Occams razor in all cases where A=0 
 
In my example one couldnt dismiss 
benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity  one of these is necessary 
to explain the dosh  I brought up the onebyone dismissal process to 
show that it would be wrong to do so  From what youre saying in this 
post it seems you agree and were talking at crosspurposes 
 
3 is still in contradiction to 1 
 
Some sums may help With B = benefactor b = bug d = dosh arrives in account 
 
  1 implies  PB+b | d = 1 
 
Assuming that PBb | d = 0 so its either the benefactor *or* a bug 
which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then 
 
   PB+b | d   =   PB | d + Pb | d 
 
so 
 
   PB | d + Pb | d  =  1 
 
but 3 implies that 
 
   PB | d  =  0  and  Pb | d
