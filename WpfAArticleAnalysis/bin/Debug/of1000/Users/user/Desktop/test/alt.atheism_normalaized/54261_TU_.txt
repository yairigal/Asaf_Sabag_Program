THIS IS A STANDARD ARGUMENT FOR FUNDIES.  CAN YOU SPOT THE FALICY? THE
STATEMENT IS ARGUING FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT JESUS ACTUALLY EXISTED.  SO FAR,
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OFFER REAL PROOF OF THAT EXISTANCE.  MOST OF THEM
TRY IT USING THE (VERY) FLAWED WRITINGS OF JOSH MCDOWELL AND OTHERS TO PROVE
IT, BUT THOSE WRITERS USE VERY FLAWED SOURCES.  (IF THEY ARE REAL SOURCES AT
ALL, SOME ARE NOT.)  WHEN WILL THEY EVER LEARN TO DO REAL RESEARCH, INSTEAD OF
BELIEVING THE DRIVEL SOLD IN THE CHRISTIAN BOOKSTORES.

RH> RIGHTO, DAN, TRY THIS ONE WITH YOUR CORNFLAKES...

RH> THE BOOK SAYS THAT MUHAMMAD WAS EITHER A LIAR, OR HE WAS
RH> CRAZY ( A  MODERN DAY MAD MAHDI) OR HE WAS ACTUALLY WHO HE
RH> SAID HE WAS. SOME REASONS WHY HE WOULDN'T BE A LIAR ARE AS

RH> TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR?  PEOPLE  GATHERED AROUND HIM AND
RH> KEPT DOING IT, MANY GATHERED FROM HEARING OR SEEING  HOW HIS
RH> SON-IN-LAW MADE THE SUN STAND STILL.  CALL ME A FOOL, BUT I
RH> BELIEVE  HE DID MAKE THE SUN STAND STILL.  
RH> NIETHER WAS HE A LUNATIC.  WOULD MORE THAN AN ENTIRE NATION
RH> BE DRAWN  TO SOMEONE WHO WAS CRAZY.  VERY DOUBTFUL, IN FACT
RH> REDICULOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE  ANYONE WHO IS DRAWN TO THE MAD
RH> MAHDI IS OBVIOUSLY A FOOL, LOGICAL PEOPLE SEE  THIS RIGHT

RH> THEREFORE SINCE HE WASN'T A LIAR OR A LUNATIC, HE MUST HAVE

NICE REBUTAL!
