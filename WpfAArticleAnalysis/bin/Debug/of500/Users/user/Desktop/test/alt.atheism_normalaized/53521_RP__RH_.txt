It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about 
If only those christian scientists would take note 
 
In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian  
scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly 
true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified 
by using the laws of physics  For example there are a few chaps who are  
trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old and that the 
error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  
light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been  
accounted for

Or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never  
intended to become a manifesto for a billion people  Did Tony follow that one 
up

Millions of people have died for a lie  This  point is difficult to  
substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments 
work in that way but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  
themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory 
of the Spanish invaders
