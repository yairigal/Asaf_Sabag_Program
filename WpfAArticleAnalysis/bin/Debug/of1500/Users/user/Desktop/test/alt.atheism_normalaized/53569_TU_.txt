   ALTHOUGH I AGREE THAT CREATION IS NONSENSE, I SUBMIT THAT YOU ARE MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKE THAT CREATIONISTS COMMONLY DO.  IN THIS AND PREVIOUS POSTS,
I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN THE FALLACY OF FALSE DICHOTOMY; YOU HAVE
CONSISTENTLY CHARACTERIZED SCIENCE/RELIGION AS RATIONALISM/NONSENSE, WHEN
IN FACT THE LATTER DO NOT FORM A COMPLETE SET OF OPTIONS.  NEITHER DO THE
FORMER, FOR THAT MATTER.

   I WISH THAT THE SEMI-EXPLICIT LINKING OF EVOLUTION TO SO-CALLED "RATIONAL"
ATHEISM COULD BE AVOIDED; IT JUST GIVES THE CREATIONISTS FUEL FOR THEIR
OFTEN-REPEATED INCANTATION THAT "EVOLUTION LEADS TO ATHEISM."
