I SEE THE POINT ON FALSIFYING GOD AS PER THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD.  A QUESTION
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK IS THIS: WHEN SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THE SECOND LAW
DOES NOT APPLY TO THE EARTH THEY SAY IT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CLOSED SYSTEM, 
I.E. THERE IS ENERGY COMING IN FROM AN OUTSIDE FORCE -- NAMELY, THE SUN.  IS 
THE UNIVERSE A CLOSED OR OPEN SYSTEM, AND HOW COULD EITHER BE PROVEN? IF IT IS
A CLOSED SYSTEM, HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE OUTSIDE TO LOOK IN?  IF IT IS OPEN, HOW 
DO YOU KNOW?
