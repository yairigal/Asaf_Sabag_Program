But you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return  This 
person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen 
made from the proChristian people  Ive known several Jesuits who would 
laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them 
 
Lets ignore the fact that its not a true trilemma for the moment nice 
word Maddi original or is it a real word and concentrate on the 
liar lunatic part 
 
The argument claims that no one would follow a liar let alone thousands 
of people  Look at L Ron Hubbard  Now he was probably not all there 
but I think he was mostly a liar and a conartist  But look at how many 
thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology  I think the  
Bakers and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all 
the time but look at the number of follower they have 
 
As for lunatics the best example is Hitler  He was obviously insane 
his advisors certainly thought so  Yet he had a whole country entralled 
and came close to ruling all of Europe  How many Germans gave their lives 
for him  To this day he has his followers 
 
Im just amazed that people still try to use this argument  Its just 
so obviously *wrong*

If it were not for laughter there would be no Tao  **
