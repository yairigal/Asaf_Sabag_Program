 AS YOU HAVE PRESENTED IT, IT IS INDEED AN ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY.
HOWEVER, FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN, IT IS NOT OFTEN PRESENTED IN THIS MANNER.
IT IS USUALLY PRESENTED MORE IN THE FORM, "AND *BESIDES*, I CANNOT SEE...
...NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN OFFERED A CONVINCING EXPLANATION."
 MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION FOR SUCH
PHENOMENA. THAT THEISM DOES NOT PROVIDE A CONVINCING EXPLANATION IS NOT
AN ARGUMENT IN THEISM'S FAVOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN DIFFERENT THEISMS OFFER 
DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS, AND EVEN DIFFERENT ADHERENTS OF WHAT IS PURPORTEDLY
THE SAME THEISM GIVE DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS...

 NOT IM MY EXPERIENCE. IN MY EXPERIENCE, THE MOST COMMON REASON IS THE
LACK OF EVIDENCE IN THEISM'S FAVOR. YOU MILEAGE MAY VARY. :->

>TO WIT, THAT IT IS FAR EASIER TO SEE THE LOGICAL FALLACY OR INEPT REASONING

 OH, HECK, I'LL BE SNIDE THIS ONCE. :-> IT'S ALSO FAIRLY EASY TO ATTACK
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE NOT MADE. (I.E. 'STRAWMEN'.)

 SAGE ADVICE INDEED.
