"ISAAC ASIMOV READ CREATIONIST BOOKS.  HE READ THE BIBLE.  HE HAD AMPLE
OPPORTUNITY TO KNEEL BEFORE HIS CREATOR AND SAVIOR.  HE REFUSED.  IN
FACT, HE SENT OUT A STRONG PROMOTIONAL LETTER URGING SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION, SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED."

   --EXCERPT FROM KEN HAM, "ASIMOV MEETS HIS CREATOR," _BACK TO GENESIS_
     NO. 42, JUNE 1992, P. C (INCLUDED IN _ACTS & FACTS_ VOL. 21, NO. 6,
     JUNE 1992, FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR CREATION RESEARCH).  THIS IS ONE
     OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE ARTICLES THEY'VE EVER PUBLISHED--BUT AT LEAST
     IT ARGUES *AGAINST* A DEATHBED CONVERSION.  THERE'S A PART OF THE
     ARTICLE EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT I'VE JUST QUOTED, IN WHICH AN EXCERPT
     FROM A READER'S LETTER SAYS THAT IF ASIMOV IS BURNING IN HELL NOW,
     "THEN HE CERTAINLY HAS HAD A 180-DEGREE CHANGE IN HIS FORMER BELIEFS
     ABOUT CREATION AND THE CREATOR."  (A POST-DEATHBED CONVERSION.)
