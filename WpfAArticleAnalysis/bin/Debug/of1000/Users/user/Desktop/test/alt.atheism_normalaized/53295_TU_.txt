TO REPEAT WHAT I HAD SAID IN AN EARLIER POST:  EVOLUTION IS
A THEORY.  IF YOU ACCEPT IT AS FACT, THEN THAT IS FAITH AND
NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM RELIGION.  IF YOU ACCEPT IT AS THE
THEORY IT IS, THEN THERE IS 0% RELIGION INVOLVED AND IT 
CAN BE QUITE USEFUL IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE.

SIMPLY PUT, EVOLUTION/CREATION WHEN EACH IS LOOKED AT
PROPERLY -- THEORY/ASSERTION NOT FACT/FICTION -- IS A 
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF EXACTLY WHAT SEPARATES SOFT ATHIESM 
AND SCIENCE FROM RELIGION.
