I dont find it hard to believe that Ole Zlumber really believes 
the hate and ignorant prattle he writes The frightening thought is 
there are people even worse than he To say that feminism equals 
superiority over men is laughable as long as he doesnt then proceed 
to pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike 
aka the Canada slaughter that occured a few years ago But then men 
killing women is nothing new Islamic Fundamentalists just have a 
better excuse Quran

    MONTREAL Perhaps its the letter to the fiveyear old 
    daughter that shocks the most 
  
    I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what 
    happened to your parents wrote Patrick Prevost I loved 
    your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred 
  
    Police found the piece of paper near Prevosts body in his 
    apartment in northeast Montreal 
  
    They say the 39yearold mechanic committed suicide after 
    killing his wife Jocelyne Parent 31 
  
    The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had 
    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money 
    for food A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked 
    his wife with a kitchen knife cutting her throat police said 
  
    She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or 
    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks 
  
    Five children have also been slain as a result of the same 
    domestic battles 
  
    Last year in Quebec alone 29 women were slain by their 
    husbands That was more than onethird of such cases across 
    Canada according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for 
    Justice rest of article ommited 
  
Then to say that women are somehow better or should be the 
one to stay home and raise a child is also laughable Women 
have traditionally done hard labor to support a family often  
more than men in many cultures throughout history Seems to me 
it takes at least two adults to raise a child and that BOTH should 
stay home to do so
