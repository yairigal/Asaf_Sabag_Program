Count me for one The simple theory that makes accurate predictions does so 
whether or not we value it 
 
If the quality x does not exist nothing has quality x  Which part did 
you not understand 
 
Frank youre desperately confusing science with the reasons we as 
individuals and as a society *want* to do science  
 
Peter you may assert that I am confused about this all you want but 
wishing it does not make it so   A simple theory is not simple until 
someone judges it to be  A theory merely makes predictions  Predictions 
are not accurate until someone judges them to be  You are choosing 
theories at subjective whim in other words  At what point do things 
get objective Peter
