evolution = theory 
creation = fact 
vs                        Is this demonstrating the nonsense part 
evolution = assertion      
creation = fiction 
 
 
 
What is the fact of evolution  There is a difference between calling evolution a 
fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts I happen to think 
the latter is more accurate   And you said it best yourself If you assess  
the theories of evolution objectively  Why didnt you say  If you assess  
the facts of evolution objectively
