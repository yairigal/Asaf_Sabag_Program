  I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime If so 
why doesnt every crime carry a death penalty  That would be effictive 
wouldnt it  
 
  The death penalty is a punishment much like a 50 fine for speeding is 
a punishment Anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesnt much care 
about the consequences I think another problem is that people dont think 
they will get caught If I wanted to kill another person I wouldnt  
care what the penalty was if I didnt think I would get caught 
 
  If it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along  
the lines of torture
