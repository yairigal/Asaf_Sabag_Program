Ad hominem sarcastic innuendo  Absolutely  Forgotten  Hardly 
Bored  Not really   I try not to confuse life on aa with life 
 
I just cant overcome the urge to teasetaunt folks who bound FAQless 
onto aa with such a chip on their shoulder  To listen to you 
one might think we belonged to some church 
 
I appreciate the patience of others who questioned your posting 
on a linebyline content basis though its hard to know what 
impact that might have had as compared to say shovelling

>his last shit to be shoveled 
 
I think I only lamented that whatever the initial satisfactions 
past a certain point circular abuseheaping was just that
