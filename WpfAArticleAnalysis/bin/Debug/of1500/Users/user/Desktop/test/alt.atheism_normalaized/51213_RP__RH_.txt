Bobby theres a question here that I just HAVE to ask If all 
of your posts arent some sort of extended elaborate hoax why 
are you trying so hard to convince the entire civilised world 
that youre feeble minded You have a talent for saying the most 
absurd things Heres a little sign for you print it cut it out 
and put it on top of your computerterminal 
 
              ENGAGE BRAIN PRIOR TO OPERATING KEYBOARD 
 
 
Having said all that I must admit we all get a laugh from 
your stuff
