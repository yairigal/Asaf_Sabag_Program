Are you making a metaargument here  In any case you are wrong   
Think of those invisible pink unicorns 
 
>Also the existence if Jesus is not an extradinary claim   
 
I was responding to the historical accuracy of Biblical claims 
of which the existence of Jesus is only one and one that was not even 
mentioned in my post 
 
>You may want to

Wrong  That was exactly the issue  Go back and read the context 
included within my post and youll see what I mean 
 
Now that Ive done you the kindness of responding to your questions 
please do the same for me  Answer the Charley Challenges  Your claim 
that they are of the did not did so variety is a dishonest dodge 
that I feel certain fools only one person
