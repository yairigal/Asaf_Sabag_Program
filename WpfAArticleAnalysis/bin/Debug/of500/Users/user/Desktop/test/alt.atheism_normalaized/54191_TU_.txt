SORRY, FRED, BUT FOR THE PURPOSES UNDER DISCUSSION HERE, I MUST
DISAGREE.  YOUR POINT IS TRUE ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT ONE CANNOT ARGUE
AGAINST COMMUNISM BY REFERENCE TO THE CHINESE OR SOVIET EMPIRES, SINCE
THOSE DID NOT REPRESENT *TRUE* COMMUNISM.  IN JUDGING THE PRACTICAL
CONSEQUENCES OF ISLAM AS A FORCE TO CONTEND WITH IN THE WORLD TODAY,
IT IS PRECISELY THE KHOMEINI'S OF THE WORLD, THE RUSHDIE-FATWA
SUPPORTERS, AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE REACTION OF THE WORLD
MUSLIM COMMUNITY TO THOSE EXTREMISTS, THAT WE MUST LOOK TO.  PERHAPS
UNFORTUNATELY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT CONCERNED
WITH WHETHER ISLAM IS THE RIGHT RELIGION FOR THEM, OR WHETHER THE
QUR'AN COULD BE USED AS A GUIDEBOOK FOR A HYPOTHETICAL UTOPIA, BUT HOW
ISLAM AFFECTS THE WORLD AROUND THEM, OR WHAT THEIR LIVES MIGHT BE LIKE
IF ISLAM GAINS IN INFLUENCE.  WHEN I CONSIDER SUCH POSSIBILITIES, IT
IS WITH NOT INCONSIDERABLE FEAR.
