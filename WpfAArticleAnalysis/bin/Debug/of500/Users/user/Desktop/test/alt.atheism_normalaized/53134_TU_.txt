MY OWN PERSONAL AND HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE OPINION IS THAT FREEDOM
IS A GOOD THING.

HOWEVER, WHEN I HERE PEOPLE ASSERT THAT THE ONLY "TRUE" FREEDOM
IS IN FOLLOWING THE WORDS OF THIS AND THAT MESSIAH, I REALISE
THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN AGREE ON THE MEANING OF THE WORD.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT WORD X REPRESENTS AN OBJECTIVE
VALUE WHEN WORD X HAS NO OBJECTIVE MEANING?
