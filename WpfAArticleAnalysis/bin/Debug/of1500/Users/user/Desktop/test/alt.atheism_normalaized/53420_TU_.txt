|> THESE PASSAGES IN THE PAST WERE INTERPRETED BY REFERENCE TO THE TARGUMS AND
|> TO THE SEPTUAGINT.

SO WHEN THEY TOOK THE TIME TO *COPY* *THE* *TEXT* CORRECTLY, THAT INCLUDES
"OBVIOUS CORRUPTIONS?"

|> 
|> NOW, THE SEPTUAGINT DIFFERS FROM THE MASORETIC TEXT IN TWO PARTICULARS:
|> FIRST, IT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL TEXTS, AND SECOND, IN SOME PASSAGES THERE ARE
|> VARIANT READINGS FROM THE MASORETIC TEXT (IN ADDITION TO "FIXING"/PREDATING
|> THE VARIOUS CORRUPTED PASSAGES).  IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED THAT, TO THE BEST OF
|> MY KNOWLEDGE, THESE VARIATIONS ARE ONLY SIGNIFCANT TO BIBLE SCHOLARS, AND
|> HAVE LITTLE THEOLOGICAL IMPORT.

SO WHEN THEY TOOK THE TIME TO *COPY* *THE* *TEXT* CORRECTLY, THAT DOES NOT
EXCLUDE "VARIANT READINGS FROM THE MASORETIC TEXT" WHICH ARE "OF LITTLE 
THEOLOGICAL IMPORT"

|> 
|> THE DEAD SEA SCROLL MATERIALS ADD TO THIS AN ANCIENT *COPY* OF ALMOST ALL OF
|> ISAIAH AND FRAGMENTS OF VARIOUS SIZES OF ALMOST ALL OTHER OT BOOKS.  THERE
|> IS ALSO AN ABUNDANCE OF OTHER MATERIAL, BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO
|> SIGN THERE OF ANY HEBREW ANTECDENT TO THE APOCRYPHA (THE EXTRA TEXTS IN THE
|> SEPTUAGINT).  AS FAR AS ANALYSIS HAS PROCEEDED, THERE ARE ALSO VARIATIONS
|> BETWEEN THE DSS TEXTS AND THE MASORETIC VERSIONS.  THESE TEND TO REFLECT THE
|> SEPTUAGINT, WHERE THE LATTER ISN'T OBVIOUSLY IN ERROR.  AGAIN, THOUGH, THE
|> DIFFERENCES (THUS FAR) ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT THEOLOGICALLY.  THERE IS THIS BIG
|> EXPECTATION THAT THERE ARE GREAT THEOLOGICAL SURPRISES LURKING IN THE
|> MATERIAL, BUT SO FAR THIS HASN'T HAPPENED.
|> 
|> THE DSS *ARE* IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS ALMOST NO TEXTUAL TRADITION IN THE
|> OT, UNLIKE FOR THE NT.

HEY, YOU'RE THE EXPERT.
