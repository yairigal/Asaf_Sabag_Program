#>ORDINARILY, IT IS ALSO A *VALUE* JUDGEMENT, THOUGH IT NEEDN'T BE (ONE 
#>COULD "DO SCIENCE" WITHOUT BELIEVING IT WAS WORTH A DAMN IN ANY CONTEXT, 
#>THOUGH THAT HARDLY SEEMS SENSIBLE).
#NO, YOU'RE JUST OVERLOADING THE WORD "VALUE" AGAIN. IT IS AN
#ESTIMATION OF PROBABILITY OF CORRECTNESS, NOT AN ESTIMATION OF "WORTH."
#SHIT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT "WORTH" MEANS. CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
#THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING TRUTH. I COULD STILL BELIEVE
#THAT SCIENCE WAS THE MOST LIKELY WAY TO GET TRUTH, AND NOT VALUE
#SCIENCE AT ALL. 

BUT ONCE YOU MAKE A DECISION ON THE VALUE OF TRUTH, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
SCIENCE GETTING IT, THE REST FOLLOWS.  IN YOUR EXAMPLE, SCIENCE IS NECESSARILY
WORTHLESS, AND SO ARE ITS RESULTS, BECAUSE TRUTH IS WORTHLESS, ASSUMING THAT'S
ALL SCIENCE IS GOOD FOR.  AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT PHRASES SUCH AS "GOOD
FOR" FIT SO NATURALLY IN THIS CONTEXT.

#JUST BECAUSE EVALUATING AN ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION
#AND ASKING HOW MUCH YOU VALUE LIFE BOTH INVOLVE THE WORD "VALUE" DOESN'T
#MEAN THAT THEY REFER TO THE SAME THING AT ALL. I UNDERSTAND THAT
#THE WORD VALUE IS USED FOR BOTH, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN WHAT
#SENSE YOU ARE USING THE WORDS. I AGREE WITH JUDGING SCIENCE AS A
#VALUE IN THE FIRST SENSE, BUT NOT THE SECOND.

BUT I DON'T USE IT IN THE SECOND SENSE.  CONSIDER THAT F=MA IS NO 
DIFFERENT THAN F=$3 UNTIL I NOTE THE CONNECTION WITH REALITY THAT F=MA HAS, AND
F=$3 DOES NOT.  I'M MAKING A DECISION AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF F=MA
OVER OTHER EXPRESSIONS I CAN COMPUTE.  I'M VALUING IT, WHETHER IMPLICITLY OR
DIRECTLY, BECAUSE I'M SAYING THAT THINGS THAT HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY
ARE DIFFERENT TO OTHER THINGS WHICH DO NOT.  AND _NO-ONE_ POINTS
OUT AN _UNIMPORTANT_ DIFFERENCE, _EXCEPT_ TO SAY THAT IT'S UNIMPORTANT.
"IMPORTANT", "USEFUL", "WORTHY", ETC. ARE ALL WORDS WITH EVALUATIVE
POWER, QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EVALUATING AN EXPRESSION.  I'M CAREFUL
TO USE "VALUE" IN THE SENSE I MEAN, WHICH IS INVARIABLY THE FIRST.

#>#I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "NOT QUITE-SURE
#>#OBSERVATIONS?" IT GETS OBSERVED ALL THE TIME THAT IF YOU DON'T
#>#BUY INTO A WHOLE SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW SCIENCE IS
#>#DONE, THE RESULTS BECOME MEANINGLESS. 
#>WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT "IT" GETS OBSERVED ALL THE TIME?  THIS
#>IS YOUR OWN PRIVATE, SUBJECTIVE, "IT" IS IT NOT?    IT IS NOT BINDING
#>ON THE REST OF US.
#HUH? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? PEOPLE FREQUENTLY POINT OUT THE
#POINT I MADE ABOVE. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN BY 'OBSERVED'.

O.K., I MISUNDERSTOOD.  I THOUGHT YOU MEANT OBSERVED IN THE SENSE
OF 'NOT-QUITE-SURE-OBSERVATIONS', BY WHICH I MEAN THOSE UNDERTAKEN
BY PEOPLE.

#>#>DES DOES NOT WORK IN A VALUE VACUUM.  NOTHING ELSE DOES, EITHER.
#>#THIS IS JUST TRUTH BY BLATANT ASSERTION. YOUR "IN ANY IMPORTANT SENSE"
#>#SEEM TO BE JUST WEASEL WORDS.
