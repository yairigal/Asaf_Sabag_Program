I JUST WANT CLARIFY THAT I WAS THE ONE MAKING PREVIOUS POSTS ABOUT 
THIS, BUT THE ONE ABOVE IS NOT MINE; IT IS A CRITICISM OF ONE OF
MINE.  I HAVE NEVER EQUATED SCIENCE/RELIGION TO RATIONALISM/NONSENSE
OR TO ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.  WHAT I DID WAS EQUATE
EVOLUTION/CREATION TO THEORY/ASSERTION.

I BELIEVE THE LINK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT DOES NOT OCCUR WITH MY POSTS.
