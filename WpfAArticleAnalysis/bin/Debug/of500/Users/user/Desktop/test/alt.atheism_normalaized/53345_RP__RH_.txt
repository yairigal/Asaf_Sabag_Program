Wee  Its the old creationist argumentum ad quotation  Pitiful 
dishonest creationist saps like yourself seem only to know how to 
takes quotes out of context 
 
Heres another quote from the same source as your quote above 
 
Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to mean the same thing  But 
they dont  Evolution of life over a very long period of time is a 
fact if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last two 
centuries from geology paleontology molecular biology and many other 
scientific disciplines  Despite the many believers in Divine creation 
who dispute this  the probability that evolution has occurred 
approaches certainty in scientific terms  Hitching The Neck of 
the Giraffe 
 
Mr King next time you quote someone at least read the rest of what 
the person has to say before you make a fool of yourself in front of 
everyone  Of course we all know you have probably never even looked 
at the book you most likely copied that quote off some list your 
pastor gave you 
 
Another creationist builds the case against creationism  Thanks 
John
