MOST LIKELY THE TRAGIC SITUATION IN BOSNIA IS A COMBINATION OF ETHNICAL
AND RELIGIOUS MOTIVES, WHERE RELIGION IS JUST ONE ATTRIBUTE THAT SEPARATES
THE GROUPS FROM EACH OTHER.

BUT I MUST AGREE THAT THE SAD SAGA IN BOSNIA IS A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE
OF A CASE WHERE RELIGION IS NOT HELPING, INSTEAD IT IS USED AS A WEAPON
AGAINST OTHER HUMANS. AND MY SYMPATHIES ARE MOSTLY ON THE BOSNIAN SIDE,
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SERBS ARE THE OPPRESSORS, WILLING TO USE EVEN
CHRISTIANITY AS A WEAPON AGAINST THEIR FORMER FRIENDS.

CHEERS,
KENT
