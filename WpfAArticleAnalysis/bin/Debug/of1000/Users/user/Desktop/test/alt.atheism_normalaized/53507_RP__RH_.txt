Correct overstates the case  The whole point of the discussions 
has been that it is *reasonable* to assume that there was some brief 
reference to Jesus that has been doctored  By consensus this is 
the *most* reasonable of the proposed solutions  but not so much 
so as to rule out complete fabrication
