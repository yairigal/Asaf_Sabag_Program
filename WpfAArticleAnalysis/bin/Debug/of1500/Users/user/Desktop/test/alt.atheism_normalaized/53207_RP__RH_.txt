As a loyal relativist  even you can partake in the wonders of 
scientific discovery to borrow a phrase from D Letterman  Are you 
like me  Do you like science and medicine 
 
Difference is that science is based on consensus  The points above are 
well made  and obviously there is some discussion as to what the 
facts are in some cases  But if you are willing to play along with 
the definitions  you too can hit the jackpot  Science also tends to 
use the principle of totality vs locality  You can always look at a 
small part of the macrocosm  yet those miniature pieces are still a 
part of the total essence  So the facts to observe are those which 
pertain to what questions youre asking  You may place a value on the 
questions  but in many case  they are being asked just for the sake 
of asking  And you can say that youre looking at a signal instead of 
listening to noise  but the beauty of science is that it takes both 
into account the totality aspect  For science to say that light is 
a wave and NOT a particle or vice versa would be to ignore the total 
essence that is light which is based upon the agreed upon definitions 
 
Why even have definitions  Why agree upon them  Well to communicate in 
such a way so that many will understand what you are saying  Where the 
curiosity and drive come from I dont honestly know 
 
I hope I havent rambled too much  Not much sleep lately
