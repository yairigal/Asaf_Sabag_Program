Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force 
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is 
not moral say effectively the same thing 
 
Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and 
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two  
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when 
they say effectively the same thing

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what 
motivates pacifism so they obviously dont lead pacifists to to the 
same thing
