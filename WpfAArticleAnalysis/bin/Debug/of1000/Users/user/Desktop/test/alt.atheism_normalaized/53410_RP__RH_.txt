I read it when it first came out and the controversy broke Put my name 
on the waiting list at the library that way if the book was really 
offensive none of my money would find its way to the author or 
publisher and read it cover to cover to use a phrase that seems 
popular here right now 
 
And I *liked* it The writing style was a little hard to get used to but 
it was well worth the effort Coming from a similar background Rushdie 
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family and moved to England I grew up in 
New Delhi it made a strong impression on me  And he used many of the 
strange constructions of Indian English the yaar at the end of a 
sentence Butbutbut the occasional hindi phrase etc 
 
At the time I still sortakinda thought of myself as a muslim and I 
couldnt see what the flap was all about It seemed clear to me that this 
was allegory  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who 
took on the names and personae of Muhammeds wives and had not as my 
grandfather thundered implied that Muhammeds wives were prostitutes in 
short every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to 
have missed the point completely  And I wont mention the fact that the 
most militant of them had never even seen the book Oops I just did 
 
Perhaps in a deep sense the book is insulting to Islam because it 
exposes the silliness of revealed religion  why does an omnipotent deity 
need an agent She can come directly to me cant she How do we know that 
Muhammed didnt just go out into the desert and smoke something And how 
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didnt screw up or 
put in their own little verses And why can Muhammed marry more than four 
women when no other muslim is allowed to Although I think the biggest 
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to 
suppress a book sight unseen on the sayso of some holy guy Not to 
mention murder the author

>posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book 
>and had called it such things as filth and lies I would rank 
>Rushdies book with Hitlers Mein Kempf or worse and so on 
 
I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book A really 
silly argument  after all how many of these same people have read Mein 
Kampf It just made me wonder  what are they afraid of Why dont they 
just read the book and decide for themselves 
 
Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book and the absence of 
protest from the liberal muslims to Khomeinis fatwa outrage was the 
final push I needed into atheism
