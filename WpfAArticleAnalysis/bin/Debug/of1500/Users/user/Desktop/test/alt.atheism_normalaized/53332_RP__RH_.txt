Since this is altatheism I hope you dont mind if we strongly disagree 
 
 The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to  
 But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love 
 you because you made them love you or because they wanted to 
 love you     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward 
 Him  He promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself 
 
Indeed knock and it shall be opened to you Dan why didnt this work 
I firmly believed in god for 15 years but I eventually realised I was 
only deluding myself fearful to face the truth Ultimately the only reason 
what kept me believing was the fear of hell The mental states I  
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devils attempts to  
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination and it is easy 
to achieve the same mental states at will  
 
My faith was just learned fear in a disguise 
 
 Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort 
 
God is demanding too much Dan what was it I believed in for 15 years 
If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief  
what it was in my case  Id rather quit If god does not help me to 
keep the faith I cant go on  
 
Besides I am concerned with gods morality and mental health Does 
she really want us to believe in herself without any help revelations 
guidance or anything I can feel If she has created us why didnt 
she make the task any easier Why are we supposed to love someone who 
refuses to communicate with us What is the point of eternal torture 
for those who cant believe 
 
I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me 
shell know what to do  
 
 Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see 
 that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic 
 Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is 
 the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
 know more than you do now  
 
Your argument is of the type youll know once you try 
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed 
for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that  
they had lived in a virtual reality 
 
What else but reason I can use I dont have the spiritual means  
Christians often refer to My conscience disagrees with the Bible 
I dont even believe I have a soul I am fully dependent on my 
body  indeed I am this body When it goes up with flames so 
does my identity God can entertain herself with copies of me 
if she wants 
 
 To learn you must accept that which you dont know 
 
What does this mean To learn you must accept that you dont know  
something righto But to learn you must accept something I dont 
know why This is not the way I prefer to learn It is unwise to 
merely swallow everything you read Suppose I write a book telling 
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn tm has helped me in my 
daily problems would you accept this since you cant know whether 
it is true or not 
 
Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent omnipresent and loves just 
about everyone Besides He and She is guiding every writer on this planet 
you and me and not just some people who write legendary stories 
2000 years ago 
 
Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence
