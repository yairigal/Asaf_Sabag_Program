WELL, I'VE SAID THAT WHEN AN INNOCENT PERSON HAS BEEN EXECUTED, THIS IS
OBJECTIVELY A MURDER.  HOWEVER, WHO IS AT BLAME IS ANOTHER QUESTION.
IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE SOCIETY THAT SANCTIONS ANY SORTS OF EXECUTIONS--
REALIZING THE RISKS--IS TO BLAME.

YES, BUT THERE IS ALSO A PROBABLITY THAT YOU WILL KILL SOMEONE DOING
ANY RAONDOM ACTIVITY.  PRESUMABLY, YOU HAD NOT ISOLATED YOURSELF TOTALLY
FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THIS.

AND I ARGUE THAT OUR LAW SYSTEM IS A SIMILAR RISK.  PERHAPS AN INNOCENT
PERSON WILL BE PUNISHED SOMEDAY, BUT WE WORK TO PREVENT THIS.  IN FACT,
MANY CRIMINALS GO FREE AS A RESULT OF OUR TRYING TO PREVENT PUNISHMENT
OF INNOCENTS.

BUT, SUCH ACCIDENTS ARE TO BE TOTALLY EXPECTED, GIVEN THE NUMNER OF VEHICALS
ON THE ROAD.  AGAIN, THE BLAME IS ON SOCIETY.

YES, BUT THE STATE IS NOT AT FAULT IN SUCH A CASE.  THE STATE CAN ONLY DO
SO MUCH TO PREVENT FALSE WITNESSES.
