As I understand that number is deceptive  The reason is that the money 
cost was in nonoil sales for the most part  Iraq still is not allowed 
to sell oil or do many of the things under the initial sanctions but 
is still surviving

Of the 93 I have heard figures closer to 80 but I wont quibble your 
figures most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by 
enemy troops  A B52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie and we used them 
around the clock  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb 
munitions   
 
2  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse  The adjusted figures for number 
of Patriot kills of SS1 derivitives is 6070  That figure came 
not from some fluke in the Pentagon but a someone working with such 
stuff in another part of DoD 
 
3  The statement precision bombing was the norm is true around areas 
where civilians were close to the target  We dropped by tonnage very 
little bombs in populated regions explaining the figures   
 
>And of the 7 that was the smart stuff 35 hit Again  try to follow me 
>here  that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed 
 
This figure is far below all the other figures I have seen  If it 
is indeed accurate then how do you explain the discrepancy between 
that figure and other figures from international organizations 
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70 which is  
still far higher than your 35  Or does your figure say a bomb 
missed if the plane took off with it and the bomb never hit the target 
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped  Such methods 
are used all the time to lie with statistics

I have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure  Please 
post the source so its reliability can be judged
