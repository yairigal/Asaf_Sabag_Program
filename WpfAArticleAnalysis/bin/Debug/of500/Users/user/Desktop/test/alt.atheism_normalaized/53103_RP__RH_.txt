The online webster gets in some good licks too 
 
	1b1 existing only in relation to a knowing subject or willing agent 
 
	1b3 belonging to the sensible world and being intersubjectively  
	     observable or verifiable esp by scientific methods of a  
	     symptom of disease 
 
	1b4 perceptible to persons other than an affected individual 
 
For reason I cant quite pin down I particularly liked 1b4
