Obviously we have different sources Bill Moyers who happens to be a 
theist to tie this to altatheism in his PBS documentary After The 
War is my main source I think I still have it on videotape Others 
include The Nation and The Progressive 
 
The rest of the article is mere rationalisation You may claim that 
sanitation plants are strategic legitimate targets but what happens to 
the civilians in a city with no sewer system What happens to the 
civilians when you destroy water purification plants And when hospitals 
cant handle the resultant epidemics because there is no more electricity 
 
And what exactly are your sources We have all Im sure seen Postols 
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about 
the Patriots effectiveness what is your source for the 70 
effectiveness you claim 
 
In any case I dont know if this is relevant to altatheism How about 
if we move it somewhere else
