SOME DELETED

>>>       SINCE YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE MESSIAH, I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING
>>>        TO THE NEW TESTAMENT.  PLEASE DETAIL YOUR COMPLAINTS OR E-MAIL IF
>>>        YOU DON'T WANT TO POST.  FIRST-CENTURY GREEK IS WELL-KNOWN AND
>>>        WELL-UNDERSTOOD.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOSEPHUS, THE JEWISH HISTORIAN,
>>>        WHO ALSO WROTE OF JESUS?  IN ADDITION, THE FOUR GOSPEL ACCOUNTS
>>>        ARE VERY MUCH IN HARMONY.

>>BILL, I HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO EXPLAIN THAT BIBLICAL SCHOLARS CONSIDER THE
>>JOSEPHUS REFERENCE TO BE AN EARLY CHRISTIAN INSERT.  BY BIBLICAL SCHOLAR I MEAN
>>AN EXPERT WHO, IN THE COURSE OF HIS OR HER RESEARCH, IS WILLING TO LET THE
>>CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY.  THIS EXCLUDES LITERALISTS, WHO MAY OTHERWISE BE
>>DEFINED AS BIBLICAL APOLOGISTS.  THEY FIND WHAT THEY WANT TO FIND.  THEY ARE
>>NOT TRUSTWORTHY BY SCHOLARLY STANDARDS (AND OTHERS).
>> 
>>WHY AN INSERT?  READ IT - I HAVE, A NUMBER OF TIMES.  THE PASSAGE IS GLARINGLY
>>OUT OF CONTEXT, AND JOSEPHUS, A SUPERB WRITER, HAD NO SUCH PROBLEM ELSEWHERE 
>>IN HIS WORK.  THE PASSAGE HAS *NOTHING* TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER IN WHICH 
>>IT LIES.  IT SUDDENLY APPEARS AND THEN JUST AS QUICKLY DISAPPEARS.

>I THINK THIS IS A WEAK ARGUMENT.  THE FACT IS, THERE ARE *TWO* REFERENCES TO
>JESUS IN _ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS_, ONE OF WHICH HAS UNQUESTIONABLY AT LEAST
>BEEN ALTERED BY CHRISTIANS.  ORIGEN WROTE, IN THE THIRD CENTURY, THAT
>JOSEPHUS DID NOT RECOGNIZE JESUS AS THE MESSIAH, WHILE THE LONG PASSAGE
>SAYS THE OPPOSITE.  THERE IS AN ARABIC MANUSCRIPT OF _ANTIQUITIES OF THE
>JEWS_ WHICH CONTAINS A VERSION OF THE PASSAGE WHICH IS MUCH LESS GUNG-HO
>FOR JESUS AND MAY BE AUTHENTIC.
>   THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT ORIGEN, IN THE THIRD CENTURY, SAW A REFERENCE
>TO JESUS IN JOSEPHUS.  THERE ARE NO MANUSCRIPTS OF _ANTIQUITIES_ WHICH

>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS FABRICATED OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH AND INSERTED, BUT

EVIDENTLY JIM THINKS I AM ARGUING AN `EXISTENCE' ISSUE.  IT SHOULD BE CLEAR
