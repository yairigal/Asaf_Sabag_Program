YES.

WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOAL OF "NATURAL" MORALITY IS THE SURVIVAL AND
PROPOGATION OF THE SPECIES.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MORAL SYSTEM IS
PRESENTED WITHIN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, WHICH STATES THAT WE
SHOULD BE GUARANTEED LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  YOU SEE,
TO HAVE A MORAL SYSTEM, WE MUST DEFINE THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM.  THAT IS,
WE SHALL BE MORAL UNTO WHAT END?

WELL, MURDER VIOLATES THE GOLEN RULE, WHICH IS CERTAINLY A PILLAR OF MOST
EVERY MORAL SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, I AM NOT ASSUMING THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM
AND THE MANNER OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION ARE OBJECTIVELY MORAL.  I THINK THAT
IT IS A VERY GOOD APPROXIMATION, BUT WE CAN'T BE PERFECT.

WELL, "OBJECTIVE" WOULD ASSUME A SYSTEM BASED ON CLEAR AND FUNDAMENTAL
CONCEPTS, WHILE "ARBITARY" IMPLIES NO CLEAR LINE OF REASONING.
