The argument goes as follows Qoid quotes appear in John but not in 
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke However they are 
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such and 
not an entirely different source

We are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors The usual 
explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke does not consider 
their respective ages It says Matthew has read the text of Mark and Luke 
that of Matthew and probably that of Mark 
  
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Lukes text The evidence 
for that is not overwhelming admittedly

When they are from about 200 why do they shed doubt on the order on 
putting John after the rest of the three

Sure an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be 
fine So whats that supposed to say Am I missing something
