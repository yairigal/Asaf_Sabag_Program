: UNABATED PASSION 8-).

MIKE,

I'VE SEEN REFERRENCES TO "CREATION VS EVOLUTION" SEVERAL TIMES IN A.A
AND I HAVE QUESTION. IS EITHER POINT OF VIEW DERIVED FROM DIRECT
OBSERVATION; CAN EITHER BE SCIENTIFIC? I WONDER IF THE WHOLE
CONTROVERSY IS MORE CONCERNED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE "TRUTH"
RATHER THAN THE TRUTH ITSELF. 
BOTH SIDES SEEM TO HOLD TO A PHILOSOPHICAL OUTCOME, AND I CAN'T HELP
WONDERING WHICH CAME FIRST. AS I'VE POINTED OUT ELSEWHERE, MY VIEW OF
HUMAN NATURE MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING
ANYHTHING OBJECTIVELY - ALL KNOWLEDGE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE. SO, IN
THE CONTEXT OF A.A, WOULD YOU TAKE A STAND BASED ON WHAT YOU ACTUALLY
KNOW TO BE TRUE OR ON WHAT YOU WANT TO BE TRUE AND HOW CAN YOU TELL
THE DIFFERENCE?

BILL
