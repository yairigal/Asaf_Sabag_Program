THAT MEANS THAT IT IS AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-RECIDIVISM MEASURE.  IT DOES
NOT SAY THAT IT DETERS AN INDIVIDUAL FROM COMMITTING A CAPITAL CRIME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

THE TRUE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE THREAT OF DEATH IS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY
STOP ONE FROM MURDERING.  (OR COMMITING TREASON -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER
CAPITAL CRIMES ANYWHERE IN THE USA?)  THAT IS, IF THERE WERE NO DEATH
PENALTY, WOULD ITS INTRODUCTION DETER A WOULD-BE CRIMINAL FROM
COMMITTING HER/HIS CRIME?  I DOUBT IT.

THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP.  EVEN IF IT WERE A STRONG DETERRENT
(SHORT OF BEING A COMPLETE DETERRENT) I WOULD REJECT IT.  FOR WHAT
ABOUT THE CASE OF THE INNOCENT EXECUTED?

AND EVEN IF WE COULD ELIMINATE THIS POSSIBILITY, I WOULD REJECT THE
DEATH PENALTY AS IMMORAL. THIS MAKES ME SOMETHING OF A RADICAL ON
THE ISSUE, ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE ARE MANY OPPONENTS OF CAPTIAL
PUNISHMENT WHO AGREE WITH ME, BUT WHO FIND THE INNOCENT EXECUTED THE
STRONGEST ARGUMENT TO MAKE.

I WOULD, IF MAGICALLY PLACED IN CHARGE, FACILITATE STATE-AIDED SUICIDE
FOR CRIMINALS WHO HAVE LIFE-SENTENCES.  THIS COULD BE A REPLACEMENT
FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.  THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE THE REST OF
THEIR LIVES IN JAIL WOULD ALWAYS HAVE THIS OPTION.
