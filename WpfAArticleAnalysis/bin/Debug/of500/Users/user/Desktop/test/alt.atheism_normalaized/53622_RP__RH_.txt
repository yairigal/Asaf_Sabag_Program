Tiring to say the least I have backed it up read the first statement 
 
I have read it  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point 
 
  
The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy Saying someone believes 
something is hardly an information about the person at all Saying someone 
is a theist holds much more information Further the correlation between 
theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism 
because of the special features of theistic belief 
 
Truth by blatant assertion  Evidence

You Frank ODwyer are living in a dream world I wonder if there is any 
base of discussion left after such a statement As a matter of fact I think 
you are ignorant of human nature Even when one starts with something one does 
not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says 
  
To give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement 
 
The onus of proof is on you sunshine
