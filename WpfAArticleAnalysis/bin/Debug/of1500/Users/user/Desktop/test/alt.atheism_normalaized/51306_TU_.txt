I HAVE A REQUEST FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHARLEY WINGATE
RESPOND TO THE "CHARLEY CHALLENGES" (AND JUDGING FROM MY E-MAIL, THERE
APPEAR TO BE QUITE A FEW OF YOU.)  

IT IS CLEAR THAT MR. WINGATE INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO POST TANGENTIAL OR
UNRELATED ARTICLES WHILE INGORING THE CHALLENGES THEMSELVES.  BETWEEN
THE LAST TWO RE-POSTINGS OF THE CHALLENGES, I NOTED PERHAPS A DOZEN OR
MORE POSTS BY MR. WINGATE, NONE OF WHICH ANSWERED A SINGLE CHALLENGE.  

IT SEEMS UNMISTAKABLE TO ME THAT MR. WINGATE HOPES THAT THE QUESTIONS
WILL JUST GO AWAY, AND HE IS DOING HIS LEVEL BEST TO CHANGE THE
SUBJECT.  GIVEN THAT THIS SEEMS A RATHER COMMON NET.THEIST TACTIC, I
WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE IMPRESS UPON HIM OUR DESIRE FOR ANSWERS,
IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:

1. IGNORE ANY FUTURE ARTICLES BY MR. WINGATE THAT DO NOT ADDRESS THE
CHALLENGES, UNTIL HE ANSWERS THEM OR EXPLICTLY ANNOUNCES THAT HE
REFUSES TO DO SO.

--OR--

2. IF YOU MUST RESPOND TO ONE OF HIS ARTICLES, INCLUDE WITHIN IT
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING:

    "PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU IN THE CHARLEY CHALLENGES."

REALLY, I'M NOT LOOKING TO HUMILIATE ANYONE HERE, I JUST WANT SOME
HONEST ANSWERS.  YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT HONESTY WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO
ASK FROM A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN, WOULD YOU?  

NEVERMIND, THAT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION.
