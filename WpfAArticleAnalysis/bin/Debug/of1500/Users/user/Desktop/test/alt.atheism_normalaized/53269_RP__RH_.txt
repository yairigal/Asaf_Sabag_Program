Note that the celestial bodies in the above verse is an 
interpolation which is why it is in brackets  it is the translators  
incorrect IMHO interpretation 
 
Here is Maurice Bucailles translation he studied Arabic for his 
research into the Quran and science of this verse 
 
God is the One Who created the night the day the sun and the moon 
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion Quran 33 
 
The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr Maurice Bucaille is that 
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for 
a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse 
or anywhere in the Quran
