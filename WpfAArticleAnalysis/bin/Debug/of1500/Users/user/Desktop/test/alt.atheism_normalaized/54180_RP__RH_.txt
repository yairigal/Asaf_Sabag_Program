So what youre saying is that your mind is made up and youll just explain 
away any differences at being statistically insignificant

So youll just explain away any inconsistancies in your theory as being 
a special case

You just equated them  Reread your own words

A study release in 1991 found that 11 of female seagulls are lesbians

Now apply this last sentence of your to YOUR theory  Notice how your are 
contridicting observations

You dont know much math do you  The ability to use SAS to determine the 
length of the third side of the triangle is fundemental to geometry

Goals postulates 
 
Again if one of the goals of this objectivenatural morality system 
you are proposing is survival of the species then homosexuality is 
immoral
