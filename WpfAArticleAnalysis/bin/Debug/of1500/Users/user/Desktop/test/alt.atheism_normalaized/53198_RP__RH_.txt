You know it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing 
can be blamed solely on Mary 
 
So shes married to Joseph  She gets knocked up  What do you think 
ol Joe will do if he finds shes been getting around  So Mary comes up 
with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant  Actually it 
cant be all THAT ridiculous considering the number of people that 
believe it  Anyway she never tells anyone the truth and even tells 
poor little Jesus that hes hot shit the Son of God  Everyone else 
tells him this too since theyve bought Marys story  So what does 
Mary actually turn out to be  An adultress and a liar and the cause of 
mankinds greatest folly 
 
Just my recentlyminted two cents
