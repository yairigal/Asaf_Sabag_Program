I guess Im delving into a religious language area  What exactly is morality  
or morals  I never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral but I think 
it could be  How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is 
a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as  
immoral  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are 
 
Also consensus positions fall to a might makes right  Or as you brought out 
if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control 
at the time makes what is right
