KEITH M. RYAN (KMR4@PO.CWRU.EDU) WROTE:
: 
: 	WILD AND FANCIFUL CLAIMS REQUIRE GREATER EVIDENCE. IF YOU STATE THAT 
: ONE OF THE BOOKS IN YOUR ROOM IS BLUE, I CERTAINLY DO NOT NEED AS MUCH 
: EVIDENCE TO BELIEVE THAN IF YOU WERE TO CLAIM THAT THERE IS A TWO HEADED 
: LEAPARD IN YOUR BED. [ AND I DON'T MEAN A MALE LOVER IN A LEOTARD! ]

KEITH, 

IF THE ISSUE IS, "WHAT IS TRUTH" THEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHATEVER
PROPOSITION ARGUED IS IRRELEVENT. IF THE ISSUE IS, "WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES
IF SUCH AND SUCH -IS- TRUE", THEN TRUTH IS IRRELEVENT. WHICH IS IT TO
BE?
