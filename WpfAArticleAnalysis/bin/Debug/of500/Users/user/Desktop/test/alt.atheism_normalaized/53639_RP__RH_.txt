      Wrong point The age of the universe has no direct effect on 
humanitys sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can 
have 
 
      Im saying the Universe has a real age because I see evidence 
for it cosmology astronomy and so on I say this age is independent of 
peoples opinions of it because I know different people have a lot of 
different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem 
to give roughly the same results

performing the tests and calculations see to it she makes no blatant 
errors in measuring
