I hate doing this because its been done so many times before but 
 
Evolution in the nonscientific sense is change  Although it is 
often used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tend 
toward higher complexity and ability evolution simply implies change 
for good or for bad  In the scientific sense evolution is merely the 
change in allele frequencies for a given population over a period of 
time  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss the 
scientific fact of evolution  We observe such shifts in allele 
frequencies occurring all the time so it is trivial to conclude that 
evolution is a scientific fact 
 
The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies are 
collectively known as the theory of evolution  Darwins natural 
selection is one such theory  Genetic drift is another  Gene flow is 
still another 
 
Evolution is a fact and a theory  I posted Larry Morans lengthy 
article on this topic a couple days ago  Why dont you go back and 
read it
