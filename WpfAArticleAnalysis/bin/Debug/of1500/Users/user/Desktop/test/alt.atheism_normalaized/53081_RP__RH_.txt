  If the emphasis is on the in general then of course youre 
  correct since you havent really said anything  If we restrict 
  our observations to practiced religions there are lots of 
  examples of god mandated genocide  Just ask the Canaanites  The 
  point is that if you believe in a god and if you believe he has 
  ordered you to eliminate an entire race you will likely make the 
  attempt  After all if it was OK in the past it could surely be 
  OK in the present
