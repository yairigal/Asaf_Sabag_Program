I AM LOOKING FOR EXPERIENCES PEOPLE HAVE HAD WITH MORMONS AND YOUR
VIEWS OF MORMONISM BECAUSE OF THESE EXPERIENCES.

I WOULD APPRECIATE ONLY EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU...NOT
FRIEND OF A FRIEND STUFF.  ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR GOOD 
EXPERIENCES YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD WITH MORMONS.  I AM DOING THIS
IN THE INTEREST OF SPREADING TOLERANCE, SO PLEASE, NO FLAMES.

E-MAIL WOULD BE PREFERRED BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TIME FOR THIS.

THANKS,

--TRAVIS
