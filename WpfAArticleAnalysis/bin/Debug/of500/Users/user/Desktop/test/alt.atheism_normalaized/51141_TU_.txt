THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF EXCESSIVE FAITH IN REASON.  THE FACT THAT WE
HAVE TROUBLE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING DOESN'T IMPLY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE; IT
SIMPLY IMPLIES THAT IT IS HARD TO TALK ABOUT.  THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THAT GOD *CAN* FLIBBLE GLOP ORK GROINK.  CHARLIE WINGATE CAN FLIBBLE GLOP
ORK GROINK, AND HE ISN'T EVEN GOD.
