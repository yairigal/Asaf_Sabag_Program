Okay so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable 
evidence  I didnt realize you were a theist  I am doubting a claim 
presented without any evidence to support it  If you are able to present 
real evidence for it then great  But unsupported claims or even claims 
by such and such news agency will not be accepted  If you want to 
stick to the sheer impossible instead of the merely difficult then 
fine   
 
The statement that if such a fact is classified then you  
cant prove it is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law  If you  
have access to classified information that you know to be classified 
and you reveal it there is a good chance that you or someone else  
the person who revealed it to you is going to jail   
 
I never said that you couldnt prove it to my satisfaction I merely 
said that it was difficult  Who said I try and make things easy 
for people I am arguing with  Unless of course they need the 
handicap
