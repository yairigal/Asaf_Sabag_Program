I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part 
about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years thinking instead that 
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit 
about killing Palestinians  In retrospect I can see how the 
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many  I originally saw 
it just as poetic license but its understandable that others 
might see it differently  I still think that Ken came on a bit 
strong though  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan 
 
  Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee its a good idea to 
  do a little homework or at least think 
 
was unnecessary

Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit 
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual 
antisemitism  If I agreed with that then maybe your speech 
on why this is bad might have been relevant  But I think youre 
reading a lot into one flip sentence  While probably not 
true in this case too often the charge of antisemitism gets 
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the 
state of Israel 
 
Anyway Id rather be somewhere else so Im outta this thread
