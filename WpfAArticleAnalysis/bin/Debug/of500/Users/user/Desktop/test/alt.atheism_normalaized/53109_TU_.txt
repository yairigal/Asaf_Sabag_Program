>GOOD QUESTION, MY POINT WAS THAT A WORLD WITH TRUTH IS BETTER THAN A WORLD
>WITH FALSEHOOD.  A WORLD IN WHICH IT WERE POSSIBLE TO SAY "YES, I AM
>HOLDING A JEW" (THE TRUTH) AND YOU, ME, THE JEW, AND THE SS GUY ALL SIT
>DOWN TO CRACK OPEN A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY IS BETTER THAN THE GRIM ALTERNATIVES 
>YOU PRESENT. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND THE BEST ALTERNATIVE SEEMS
>TO BE TO LIE.  THAT'S BECAUSE OTHER VALUES ARE INVOLVED, SUCH AS LIFE.
>NOW THAT IS JUST MY OPINION - DON'T CONFUSE THE CLAIM 'OBJECTIVE MORALITY
>EXISTS' WITH THE CLAIM 'I HAVE A LOCK ON MORALS'.

	SO THEN, IT IS NOT OBJECTIVELY BETTER TO TELL THE TRUTH. THERE ARE 
SOME SUBJECTIVE SITUATIONS WITHIN WHICH, IT IS BETTER TO LIE.


	I AGREE THAT IT IS MY SUBJECTIVE OPINION THAT A WORLD WITHOUT SS 
TROOPS AND THE LIKE WOULD BE BETTER. IT IS ALSO WHEN USING CERTAIN SYSTEMS 
TO JUDGE THE SITUATIONS, SUCH AS UNITARIANISM, THAT IT IS OBJECTIVELY BETTER.
