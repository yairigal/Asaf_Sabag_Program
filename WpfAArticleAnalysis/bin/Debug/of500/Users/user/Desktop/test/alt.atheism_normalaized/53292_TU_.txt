SIZE OF ARMIES, DURATION, NUMBERS OF CASUALTIES BOTH ABSOLUTE AND AS A
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE INVOLVED, GEOGRAPHICAL AREA AND NUMBERS OF COUNTRIES
TOO, ARE ALL MEASURES OF SIZE.  IN THIS CASE I'D SAY THE RELEVANT
STATISTIC WOULD BE THE NUMBER OF COMBATANTS (TOTAL TROOPS) COMPARED TO
TOTAL CASUALTIES FROM AMONG THE TOTAL CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE
AFFECTED GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.

VIETNAM AND KOREA MIGHT MAKE GOOD COMPARISONS.

WESTERN NEWS IN GENERAL, BUT IN PARTICULAR THE AMERICAN "MASS MEDIA":
CBS, NBC, ABC, ETC.  THE GENERAL TONE OF THE NEWS DURING THE WHOLE
WAR WAS ONE OF "THOSE POOR, POOR IRAQIS" ALONG WITH "LOOK HOW PRECISELY
THIS CRUISE MISSILE BLEW THIS BUILDING TO BITS".

PERHAPS SO.  AND MAYBE THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS A MISTAKE TOO.  BUT THAT'S EASY
TO SAY FROM OUR "ENLIGHTENED" VIEWPOINT HERE IN THE 90'S, RIGHT?  BACK
THEN, IT WAS *ALL-OUT* WAR, AND GERMANY AND JAPAN HAD TO BE SQUASHED.
AFTER ALL, A MILLION OR MORE BRITISH HAD ALREADY DIED, HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF FRENCH, A COUPLE HUNDREAD THOUSAND OR SO AMERICANS, AND 
MILLIONS OF RUSSIANS, NOT TO MENTION A FEW MILLION
