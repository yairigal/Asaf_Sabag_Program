ABSTRACT, IS THAT IT CREATES INFORMATION FROM NO INFORMATION.  THIS IS
CONSIDERED INVALID IN INFORMATION THEORY.  STATEMENT 1 INDICATES ONE HAS NO
INFORMATION ABOUT GOD -- BUT STATEMENT 2 INDICATES THAT BENEFICIAL INFORMATION
CAN BE GAINED FROM THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT GOD.  THIS VIOLATES
INFORMATION ENTROPY -- INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM NO INFORMATION, AT
NO "COST".

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IS TO CLAIM THAT 1 AND 2 ARE BOTH ASSUMPTIONS.  THE
PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT 2 IS THEN BASICALLY AN ASSUMPTION WHICH STATES THE
CHRISTIAN POSITION, AND ONLY A CHRISTIAN WILL AGREE WITH THAT ASSUMPTION. THE
ARGUMENT THUS COLLAPSES TO "IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, IT IS IN YOUR INTERESTS
TO BELIEVE IN GOD" -- A RATHER VACUOUS TAUTOLOGY, AND NOT THE WAY PASCAL
INTENDED THE ARGUMENT TO BE VIEWED.

THE BIGGEST REASON WHY PASCAL'S WAGER IS A FAILURE IS THAT IF GOD IS
OMNISCIENT HE WILL CERTAINLY KNOW WHO REALLY BELIEVES AND WHO BELIEVES AS
A WAGER.  HE WILL SPURN THE LATTER... ASSUMING HE ACTUALLY CARES AT ALL
WHETHER PEOPLE BELIEVE IN HIM.

SUBJECT: WHAT IS OCCAM'S RAZOR?

TYPICAL POSTING:

PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR.  WHAT IS IT?

RESPONSE:

WILLIAM OF OCCAM FORMULATED A PRINCIPLE WHICH HAS BECOME KNOWN AS OCCAM'S 
RAZOR.  IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, IT SAID "DO NOT MULTIPLY ENTITIES 
UNNECESSARILY."  THAT IS, IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOMETHING WITHOUT SUPPOSING
THE EXISTENCE OF SOME ENTITY, THEN DO SO.

NOWADAYS WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO OCCAM'S RAZOR, THEY GENERALLY EXPRESS IT 
MORE GENERALLY, FOR EXAMPLE AS "TAKE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION".

THE RELEVANCE TO ATHEISM IS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS 
FOR WHAT WE SEE AROUND US:

1. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE, WHICH
CAME INTO BEING AS A RESULT OF NATURAL PROCESSES.

2. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE, AND 
THERE IS ALSO A GOD WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE.  CLEARLY THIS GOD MUST BE 
OF NON-ZERO COMPLEXITY.

GIVEN THAT BOTH EXPLANATIONS FIT THE FACTS, OCCAM'S RAZOR MIGHT SUGGEST 
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THE SIMPLER OF THE TWO -- SOLUTION NUMBER ONE.
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME ARGUE THAT THERE IS A THIRD EVEN MORE SIMPLE SOLUTION:

3. THERE ISN'T AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE.  
WE JUST IMAGINE THAT THERE IS.

THIS THIRD OPTION LEADS US LOGICALLY TOWARDS SOLIPSISM, WHICH MANY PEOPLE 
FIND UNACCEPTABLE.

SUBJECT: WHY IT'S GOOD TO BELIEVE IN JESUS

TYPICAL POSTING:

I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE VIRTUES AND BENEFITS OF MY RELIGION.

RESPONSE:

PREACHING IS NOT APPRECIATED.

FEEL FREE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR RELIGION, BUT PLEASE DO NOT WRITE POSTINGS THAT
ARE ON A "CONVERSION" THEME.  SUCH POSTINGS DO NOT BELONG ON ALT.ATHEISM AND
WILL BE REJECTED FROM ALT.ATHEISM.MODERATED (TRY THE NEWSGROUP
TALK.RELIGION.MISC).

YOU WOULD DOUBTLESS NOT WELCOME POSTINGS FROM ATHEISTS TO YOUR FAVOURITE
NEWSGROUP IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONVERT YOU; PLEASE DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD
HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU!

OFTEN THEISTS MAKE THEIR BASIC CLAIMS ABOUT GOD IN THE FORM OF LENGTHY
ANALOGIES OR PARABLES.  BE AWARE THAT ATHEISTS HAVE HEARD OF GOD AND KNOW THE
BASIC CLAIMS ABOUT HIM; IF THE SOLE PURPOSE OF YOUR PARABLE IS TO TELL
ATHEISTS THAT GOD EXISTS AND BRINGS SALVATION, YOU MAY AS WELL NOT POST IT,
SINCE IT TELLS US NOTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD BEFORE.

------------------------------

SUBJECT: WHY I KNOW THAT GOD EXISTS

TYPICAL POSTING:

I *KNOW* FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND PRAYER THAT GOD EXISTS.

RESPONSE:

JUST AS MANY THEISTS HAVE PERSONAL EVIDENCE THAT THE BEING THEY WORSHIP
EXISTS, SO MANY ATHEISTS HAVE PERSONAL EVIDENCE THAT SUCH BEINGS DO NOT
EXIST.  THAT EVIDENCE VARIES FROM PERSON TO PERSON.

FURTHERMORE, WITHOUT WISHING TO DISMISS YOUR EVIDENCE OUT OF HAND, MANY
PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED ALL KINDS OF UNLIKELY THINGS -- THAT THEY HAVE BEEN
ABDUCTED BY UFOS, VISITED BY THE GHOST OF ELVIS, AND SO ON.

SUBJECT: EINSTEIN AND "GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE"

TYPICAL POSTING:

ALBERT EINSTEIN BELIEVED IN GOD.  DO YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVERER THAN HIM?

RESPONSE:

EINSTEIN DID ONCE COMMENT THAT "GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE [WITH THE UNIVERSE]". 
THIS QUOTATION IS COMMONLY MENTIONED TO SHOW THAT EINSTEIN BELIEVED IN THE
CHRISTIAN GOD.  USED THIS WAY, IT IS OUT OF CONTEXT; IT REFERS TO EINSTEIN'S
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE UNCERTAINTIES INDICATED BY QUANTUM THEORY. FURTHERMORE,
EINSTEIN'S RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WAS JEWISH RATHER THAN CHRISTIAN.

A BETTER QUOTATION SHOWING WHAT EINSTEIN THOUGHT ABOUT GOD IS THE FOLLOWING:
"I BELIEVE IN SPINOZA'S GOD WHO REVEALS HIMSELF IN THE ORDERLY HARMONY OF
WHAT EXISTS, NOT IN A GOD WHO CONCERNS HIMSELF WITH FATES AND ACTIONS OF
HUMAN BEINGS."

EINSTEIN WAS UNABLE TO ACCEPT QUANTUM THEORY BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEF IN AN
OBJECTIVE, ORDERLY REALITY; A REALITY WHICH WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO RANDOM
EVENTS AND WHICH WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT UPON THE OBSERVER.  HE BELIEVED THAT
QM WAS INCOMPLETE, AND THAT A BETTER THEORY WOULD HAVE NO NEED FOR
STATISTICAL INTERPRETATIONS.  SO FAR NO SUCH BETTER THEORY HAS BEEN FOUND,
AND MUCH EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT IT NEVER WILL BE.

A LONGER QUOTE FROM EINSTEIN APPEARS IN "SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND RELIGION, A
SYMPOSIUM", PUBLISHED BY THE CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION
IN THEIR RELATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC WAY OF LIFE, INC., NEW YORK, 1941.  IN
IT HE SAYS:

  "THE MORE A MAN IS IMBUED WITH THE ORDERED REGULARITY OF ALL EVENTS
   THE FIRMER BECOMES HIS CONVICTION THAT THERE IS NO ROOM LEFT BY THE SIDE
   OF THIS ORDERED REGULARITY FOR CAUSES OF A DIFFERENT NATURE.  FOR HIM
   NEITHER THE RULE OF HUMAN NOR THE RULE OF DIVINE WILL EXISTS AS AN
   INDEPENDENT CAUSE OF NATURAL EVENTS.  TO BE SURE, THE DOCTRINE OF A
   PERSONAL GOD INTERFERING WITH NATURAL EVENTS COULD NEVER BE
   *REFUTED* [ITALICS HIS], IN THE REAL SENSE, BY SCIENCE, FOR THIS
   DOCTRINE CAN ALWAYS TAKE REFUGE IN THOSE DOMAINS IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC
   KNOWLEDGE HAS NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO SET FOOT.

   BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT SUCH BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF REPRESENTATIVES
   OF RELIGION WOULD NOT ONLY BE UNWORTHY BUT ALSO FATAL.  FOR A DOCTRINE
   WHICH IS TO MAINTAIN ITSELF NOT IN CLEAR LIGHT BUT ONLY IN THE DARK,
   WILL OF NECESSITY LOSE ITS EFFECT ON MANKIND, WITH INCALCULABLE HARM
   TO HUMAN PROGRESS.  IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR THE ETHICAL GOOD, TEACHERS
   OF RELIGION MUST HAVE THE STATURE TO GIVE UP THE DOCTRINE OF A PERSONAL
   GOD, THAT IS, GIVE UP THAT SOURCE OF FEAR AND HOPE WHICH IN THE PAST
   PLACED SUCH VAST POWER IN THE HANDS OF PRIESTS.  IN THEIR LABORS THEY
   WILL HAVE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THOSE FORCES WHICH ARE CAPABLE
   OF CULTIVATING THE GOOD, THE TRUE, AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN HUMANITY
   ITSELF.  THIS IS, TO BE SURE, A MORE DIFFICULT BUT AN INCOMPARABLY
   MORE WORTHY TASK..."

EINSTEIN HAS ALSO SAID:

  "IT WAS, OF COURSE, A LIE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT MY RELIGOUS CONVICTIONS,
   A LIE WHICH IS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY REPEATED.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN A
   PERSONAL GOD AND I HAVE NEVER DENIED THIS BUT HAVE EXPRESSED IT CLEARLY.
   IF SOMETHING IS IN ME WHICH CAN BE CALLED RELIGIOUS THEN IT IS THE
   UNBOUNDED ADMIRATION FOR THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD SO FAR AS OUR
   SCIENCE CAN REVEAL IT."

THE LATTER QUOTE IS FROM "ALBERT EINSTEIN: THE HUMAN SIDE", EDITED BY HELEN 
DUKAS AND BANESH HOFFMAN, AND PUBLISHED BY PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS.  
ALSO FROM THE SAME BOOK:

  "I DO NOT BELIEVE IN IMMORTALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL, AND I CONSIDER ETHICS
   TO BE AN EXCLUSIVELY HUMAN CONCERN WITH NO SUPERHUMAN AUTHORITY BEHIND 
   IT."

OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT EINSTEIN CHOSE NOT TO BELIEVE IN CHRISTIANITY DOES 
NOT IN ITSELF IMPLY THAT CHRISTIANITY IS FALSE.

SUBJECT: EVERYONE WORSHIPS SOMETHING

TYPICAL POSTING:

EVERYONE WORSHIPS SOMETHING, WHETHER IT'S MONEY, POWER OR GOD.

RESPONSE:

IF THAT IS TRUE, EVERYONE IS A POLYTHEIST.  THEISTS CARE JUST AS MUCH ABOUT
THOSE THINGS THAT ATHEISTS CARE ABOUT.  IF THE ATHEISTS' REACTIONS TO (FOR
EXAMPLE) THEIR FAMILIES AMOUNT TO WORSHIP THEN SO DO THE THEISTS'.

------------------------------

SUBJECT: WHY THERE MUST BE A CAUSELESS CAUSE

TYPICAL POSTING:

SETS OF INTEGERS THAT HAVE A LOWER BOUND EACH HAVE A SMALLEST MEMBER, SO
CHAINS OF CAUSES MUST ALL HAVE A FIRST ELEMENT, A CAUSELESS CAUSE.

RESPONSE:

THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS GREATER THAN ZERO HAS A DEFINITE LOWER BOUND, BUT HAS
NO SMALLEST MEMBER.

FURTHER, EVEN IF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE MUST BE A CAUSELESS CAUSE, THAT DOES
NOT IMPLY THAT THAT CAUSE MUST BE A CONSCIOUS SUPERNATURAL ENTITY, AND
ESPECIALLY NOT THAT ANY SUCH ENTITY MUST MATCH THE DESCRIPTION FAVOURED BY
ANY PARTICULAR RELIGION.

------------------------------

SUBJECT: THE UNIVERSE IS SO COMPLEX IT MUST HAVE BEEN DESIGNED

TYPICAL POSTING:

THE PRESENCE OF DESIGN IN THE UNIVERSE PROVES THERE IS A GOD.  SURELY YOU
DON'T THINK ALL THIS APPEARED HERE JUST BY CHANCE?

RESPONSE:

THIS IS KNOWN AS THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN.

IT IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE WHETHER THERE IS ANY ELEMENT OF DESIGN IN THE
UNIVERSE. THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF LIVING
CREATURES ON THE EARTH IS EVIDENCE OF A CREATOR ARE BEST ADVISED TO READ THE
NEWSGROUP TALK.ORIGINS FOR A WHILE.

THERE IS INSUFFICIENT SPACE TO SUMMARIZE BOTH SIDES OF THAT DEBATE HERE.
HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
