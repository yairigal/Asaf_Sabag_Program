 Are you saying that their was a physical Adam and Eve and that all humans are direct decendents of only these two human beings  Then who were Cain and Ables wives  Couldnt be their sisters because AE didnt have daughters  Were they nonhumans 
 
Okay all humans are direct descendents of of a bunch of hopeful 
monsters The human race didnt evolve from one set parents but from 
thousands Do you really base your atheist on this 
 
 Considering that something like 4 out of 5 humans on this planet dont know instinctively that the Christian god exist the claim of instinctive knowledge doesnt look like it hold much water  Or are you saying that the 4 billion nonChristians in the world must fight this instinctive urge to acknowledge God and JC 
 
Did I say that people were Christians by nature or did I say that 
Christians hold that everyone knows of the God the Christians worship 
I would have thought the distinction obvious sorry Read my post 
again and see what I really said from what youve written I think 
you are just being agumentative Also your wordwrap is screwed up or 
you need to shift to 80 columns text
