Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force 
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is 
not moral say effectively the same thing 
 
Yes when you tag on the Unfortunately  then to all intents and 
purposes you are saying the same thing 
 
Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and 
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two  
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when 
they say effectively the same thing 
 
What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what 
motivates pacifism so they obviously dont lead pacifists to to the 
same thing 
 
Thats not true  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum  
force and still be a pacifist  If the minimum is 0 great   but one is 
always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief 
Not the same as force is immoral period but still tending to pacifism
