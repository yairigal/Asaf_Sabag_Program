There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both 
atheists AND theists  Im sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist 
side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at 
genocide  Perhaps since Im a bit weak on history somone here would like 
to give a list of wars causedled by theists  I can think of a few Hitler 
claimed to be a Christian for example but a more complete list would 
probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement 
is 
 
> Peace 
 
On a side note I notice you always sign your posts Peace  Perhaps you 
should take your own advice and leave the atheists in peace with their 
beliefs
