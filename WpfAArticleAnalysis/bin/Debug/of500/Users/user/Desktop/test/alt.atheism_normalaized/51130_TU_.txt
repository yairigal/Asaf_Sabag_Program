THAT'S RIGHT, AND THIS IS PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE, RIGHT?  IT WOULD BE IDEAL IF
WE COULD BELIEVE FOR A WHILE, JUST TO TRY OUT RELIGION, AND ONLY THEN
DETERMINE WHICH COURSE OF THOUGHT SUITS US BEST.  BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT
POSSIBLE.  NOT THAT RELIGION WARRANTS BELIEF, BUT THE BELIEF CARRIES WITH
IT SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL
BURDENS, TOO.

WELL, IF THERE WERE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL OR OTHER BENEFITS GAINED FROM RACISM,
THEY COULD ONLY BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD OR JUDGED BY PERSONS ACTUALLY "BELIEVING"
IN RACISM.  OF COURSE, THE PARALLEL HAPPENS TO BE A POOR ONE, BUT YOU
ORIGINATED IT.
