So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of 
their circumstances their genetics their environment their experiences 
which are not all selfdetermined 
 
Of course the idea of Hell makes the idea of free will dubious 
On the other hand the idea of Hell is not a very powerful idea 
 
	A Parable for You 
 
	There was once our main character who blah blah blah 
	One day a thug pointed a mean looking gun at OMC and 
said Do what I say or Im blasting you to hell 
	OMC thought If I believe this thug and follow the 
instructions that will be given Ill avoid getting blasted to 
hell  On the other hand if I believe this thug and do not 
follow the instructions that will be given Ill get blasted to 
hell  Hmm the more attractive choice is obvious Ill 
follow the instructions  Now OMC found the choice obvious 
because everything OMC had learned about getting blasted to 
hell made it appear very undesirable 
	But then OMC noticed that the thugs gun wasnt a real 
gun  The thugs threats were make believe 
	So OMC ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah
