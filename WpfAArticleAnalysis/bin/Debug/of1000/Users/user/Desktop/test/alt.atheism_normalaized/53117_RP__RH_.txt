Ill take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable  I base 
this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly 
of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition 
almost all would want to complain  Therefore I take it that to assert or 
believe that Freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see 
that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on 
a rainy day  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it 
it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values 
such as this exist
