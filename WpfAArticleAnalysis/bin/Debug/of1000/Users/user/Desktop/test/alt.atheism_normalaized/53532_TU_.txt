I LIVED IN TOKYO FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, AND ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY
I INTEND TO GO BACK INDEFINITELY IS THE FREEDOM ONE ENJOYS WHEN ONE CAN
WALK ANYWHERE (AND I MEAN *ANYWHERE*) AT ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT AND NOT
FEEL UNEASY, EVEN IF ONE'S FROM AN ETHNIC MINORITY AS I WAS.

CLUES FOR BOBBY (WHY DO I BOTHER?): (I) TOKYO IS A CITY, AND INNER TOKYO
IS AN INNER CITY; (II) THERE IS A NEGLIGIBLE LEVEL OF VIOLENT CRIME, AND
A STREET MURDER WILL BE A LEAD ITEM ON *NATIONAL* TV NEWS; (III) THE
POPULATION IS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ATHEISTIC.

NEXT TIME I GO FOR A STROLL AROUND BEIRUT AT NIGHT, I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW
IT COMPARES.
