At the time Ezekiel was written Israel was in apostacy again and if Im not  
mistaken Tyre was about to make war on Israel  Like I said the Prince of  
Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre  He was a wicked man  By calling Satan  
the King of Tyre Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre 
 
Dont think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one  
although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as  
being a reference to Satan I havent read Ezekiel throughly in a long  
time
