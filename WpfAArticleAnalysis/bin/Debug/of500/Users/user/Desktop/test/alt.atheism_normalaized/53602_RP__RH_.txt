 Another rightwing WASP imagining hes an oppressed minority  
Perhaps Camille Paglia is right after all 
 
I would not have any argument or problem with a peacenik if they  
stayed out of all conflicts or issues  I bet you wouldnt  Youd love it  
 
But what makes you think that sitting back saying nothing about defense 
issues and letting people like you make all the decisions is anything to do 
with their ideals
