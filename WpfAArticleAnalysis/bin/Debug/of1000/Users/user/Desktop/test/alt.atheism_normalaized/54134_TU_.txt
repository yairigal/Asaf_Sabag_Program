NO WONDER THAT WE DON'T SEE ANY DETAIL FOR THIS CLAIM. IT IS GOOD TO
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE STATEMENT THAT YOU ARE A THEIST
BY ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WITH THAT YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF A DENOMINATION.
IT IS EITHER STUPIDITY OR AN ATTEMPT AT A TRICK ANSWER. NOT UNLIKE THE
REST OF YOUR ARGUMENTS.

I AM EXTREMELY WARY OF THE WAY YOU USE WORDS. LIKE IN THIS CASE, THERE
ARE BROADER DEFINITIONS OF GODS USED BY PERSONS WHO ARE CONSIDERED BY
THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THEISTS. I HAVE POINTED TO THAT IN MY POST. YOU
USE ONE OF THEM.
 
YOUR USE OF DEFINITIONS SEEMS TO REST ON THE ASSUMPTION: BECAUSE MY
MORAL IS OBJECTIVE/ABSOLUTE OR THE OTHER BUZZ WORDS YOU ARE SO FOND
OF, EVERYBODY WILL KNOW IT, AND THERE IS NO NEED TO DEFINE IT MORE
EXACTLY.
 
AND AS A USER HAS SHOWN RECENTLY, THE EASIEST WAY TO DISPELL YOU IS
TO ASK YOU FOR DEFINITIONS.
 
 
>YOU ARE OF COURSE, FREE TO SPECULATE ON MY MOTIVES FOR OBJECTING
>TO SEEMING IRRATIONAL BIGOTRY IF YOU WISH, BUT THE FLAWS WHICH I
>POINT OUT IN YOUR ARGUMENTS STAND ON THEIR OWN MERITS.
 
SINCE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE SEEING THEM, AND MANY CORRESPONDENTS
POINT TO THE FLAWS IN YOUR REASONING RESPECTIVELY DISCUSSING, I
CAN'T SAY I AM IMPRESSED.
