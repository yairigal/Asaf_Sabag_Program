>     IF IT IS CONTRADICTORY IT CANNOT EXIST 
 
Contradictory is a property of language  If I correct this to 
 
 
      THINGS DEFINED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST 
 
I will object to definitions as reality  If you then amend it to 
 
      THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST 
 
then weve come to something which is plainly false  Failures in 
description are merely failures in description 
 
Im not an objectivist remember
