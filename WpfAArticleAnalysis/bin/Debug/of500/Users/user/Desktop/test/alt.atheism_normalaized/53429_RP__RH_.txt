Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on 
faith alone which by its nature is without justification  That 
is what I mean by the word faith belief without justification or 
belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational 
justification 
 
For example when someone says that God exists that they dont know 
why they believe God exists they can just feel it thats faith 
 
Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based 
on new information or increased mental faculty

Faith and dogma are irrational  The faith and dogma part of any religion 
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals  I claim that 
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion  If that 
makes the much overused in this context Buddism a philosophy rather 
than a religion I can live with that  Science is not a religion 
because there is no faith nor dogma

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists  If a philosopher 
is not an atheist she tends to be called a theologian 
 
A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred  Christianity is 
a special set of beliefs sanctioned by God himself and therefore 
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence 
of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes  Faith comes into play  Dogma 
comes into play  The lord works in mysterious ways is an example 
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed 
Sure interpretations of what God said are changed
