Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm 
it is infact reinforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for 
themselves The motto is dangerous in itself it tells the world that every 
*true* American is godfearing and puts down those who do not fear gods It 
doesnt need anyone to make it dangerous it does a good job itself by just 
existing on your currency
