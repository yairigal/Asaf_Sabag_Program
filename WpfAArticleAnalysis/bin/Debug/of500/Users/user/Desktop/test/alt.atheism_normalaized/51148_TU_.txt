OK, THIS IS THE ONLY THING I WILL COMMENT ON FROM STAN AT THIS TIME...
PART OF THIS FORUM WE CALL REC.SCOUTING IS FOR POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND
RELATED TOPICS.  THIS IS A POLICY DISCUSSION, AND INVOLVES RELATED 
TOPICS.  THIS IS NOT A "FRINGE" GROUP DISCUSSION.  OBVIOUSLY, IT 
ENGENDERS STRONG FEELINGS FROM ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUES AT HAND. 
WETHER A PARTICULAR VIEW IS ANTI-SOCIETAL OR NOT IS YOUR OPINION, 
AND YOURS ALONE, DON'T TRY TO MAKE IT SEEM OTHERWISE. 
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION, USE A KILL FILE. 
IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE IN THIS DISCUSSION, PLEASE DO SO, KNOWING 
FULL WELL THE IMPLICATIONS THAT APPLY.
I KNOW FOR MYSELF THAT I PLAN ON CONTINUING WITH THE DISCUSSION WHEN 
I HAVE THE WISH TO HAVE INPUT.  I FOR ONE AM TIRED OF PEOPLE TRYING TO 
SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A MATTER SIGNIFICANT FOR THIS GROUP!  IT IS, AND 
QUITE SO. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO FEEL THE IMPACT MORE CLOSELY.
