I would guess that you either mean that you dont have a problem 
swearing aligance to a nonexistant being or that you are being 
deliberatily dense considering what group this is   
 
It doesnt come quite naturally to nonbelievers such as myself 
or even to followers of other religions  Would you say it would 
be quite natural if you were forced to swear by Allah or 
Budda
