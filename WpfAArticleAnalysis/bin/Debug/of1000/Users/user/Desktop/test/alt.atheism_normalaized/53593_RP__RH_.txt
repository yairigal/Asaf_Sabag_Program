Frank relativism is not keen to make such judgements unlike 
objective systems that are keen to compare their truth with falsehood 
The problem is that there are so many competing objective moral  
systems so you have this huge semantic net of delta differences  
Maybe I should not mention the magical word that describes 
this situation  
 
relativism isnt keen    Up there someone says that relativism 
doesnt mean that all moral systems are equal  So what *does* 
relativism mean  Never having to say youre sorry   
 
Specifically Id like to know what relativism concludes when two 
people grotesquely disagree  Is it 
 
a Both are right 
 
b One of them is wrong and sometimes though perhaps rarely we have a  
    pretty good idea who it is 
 
c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so 
    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision 
 
d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that 
     whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question 
     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer 
 
e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice 
 
As I hope you can tell b and c are actually predicated on 
the assumption that values are real   so statements like these 
cant consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values 
arent part of objective reality
