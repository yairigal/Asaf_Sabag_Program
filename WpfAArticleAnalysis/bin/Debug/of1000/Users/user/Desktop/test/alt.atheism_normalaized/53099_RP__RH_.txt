Seems he didnt understand anything about realities liar lunatic 
or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus 
message 
 
Sigh it seems religion makes your mindbrain filter out anything 
that does not fit into your personal scheme  
 
So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the 
classical Lewis notion of liar lunatic or saint is indeed bound 
to become a Christian
