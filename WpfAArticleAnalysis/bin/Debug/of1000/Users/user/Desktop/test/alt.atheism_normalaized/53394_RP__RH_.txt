There are many indications that would have taken place had Saddam 
been wanting or planning on going into Saudi Arabia  There were 
none  This has been openly stated by exPentagon analysts  Pull

Actually reports from other mideast countries showed that Hussein 
was ready to make concessions due to the sanctions  We just didnt want 
him to  we wanted to crush him as well as battletest all these high 
tech toys weve built over the years

Were also hypocrites of the first magnitude  Obviously we dont give 
a shit about freedom and democracy  All we care about is our oil  Oh 
and the excuse now that the Soviets are gone from the board to keep 
a sizable military presence in the gulf region  Care to make bets about 
when ALL our troops will come home 
 
Basically Saddam was OK with us  He was a killer who tortured his 
own people used gas on them and other horrors  he was a brutal 
dictator but he was OUR brutal dictator  Once he said fuck you to 
the US he became the next Hitler  The same for Noriega  He was a 
bastard but he was OUR bastarduntil he changed his mind and went 
his own way  Then we had to get rid of him
