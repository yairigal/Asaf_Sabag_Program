REFERRING TO THE REST MASS, OR WHAT I WOULD JUST CALL MASS, AS M0...

THE "NEW DEFINITION" IS DECADES OLD! ANYONE WHO HAS WORKED WITH SR
SINCE THEN WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH IT. IF "MOST PEOPLE" ARE FAMILIAR
WITH M = GAMMA M0 (A HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ASSERTION ANYWAY), I WOULD
EXPECT IT IS ON THE LARGE PART DUE TO LEARNING SR FROM LOUSY
POPULARIZATIONS INSTEAD OF PROPER TEXTBOOKS!

WHY SHOULD WE REQUIRE E = MC^2 EVEN WHEN P != 0? BECAUSE IT'S CUTE?
SAYING M = GAMMA M0 ADDS CONFUSION. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE MIGHT THINK
THAT THE FORMULA FOR KINETIC ENERGY STILL WORKS IF M = GAAMMA M0, IE.
K.E. != 1/2 GAMMA M0 V^2.  WRONG. (IN FACT IT'S (GAMMA - 1)M0 C^2.)
HOWEVER, IF YOU SAY P = GAMMA M V YOU ALWAYS GET THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

IN THE END IT DOES BOIL DOWN TO A MATTER OF DEFINITION. YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, AND *THAT* IS INVARIANT! TO SAY THAT
THINGS ACTUALLY GET HEAVIER WHEN MOVING FAST (RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER)
MISREPRESENTS WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON: IT IS BETTER TO SAY THAT
MOMENTUM / VELOCITY IS OBSERVED TO INCREASE ACCORDING TO AN EXTERNAL
OBSERVER.

BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T STUDIED SR PROPERLY WILL STILL MAKE MISTAKES
OR MISS THE POINT REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU CALL MASS.

YES YOU DID. FROM <930423.110254.3I5.RUSNEWS.W165W@MANTIS.CO.UK>:

# AGAIN, THINGS GET TRICKY WHEN THEY MOVE FAST.  OBJECTS GET HEAVIER, SPACE
# GETS CURVED, AND REALITY GENERALLY FAILS TO LIVE UP TO ONE'S EXPECTATIONS.
