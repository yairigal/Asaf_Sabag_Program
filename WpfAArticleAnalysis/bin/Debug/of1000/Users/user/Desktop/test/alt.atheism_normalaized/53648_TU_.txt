>>DO THE FBI HAVE PROOF OF THIS YET?!

>	WHY ASK ME? I AM ONLY QUOTING THE FBI OFFICIAL. WHY NOT ASK THE FBI?

MYABE THEY'RE LYING TO COVER UP, OR MAYBE THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
AT THIS EARLY DATE, WHO CAN SAY?  BUT, IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP
TALK.ORIGINS FROM TURNING INTO THE UTTERLY POINTLESS SHOUTING MATCH
OVER THIS THAT I SEE T.R.M HAS BECOME, I HAVE EDITTED THE FOLLOWUP
LINE OF THIS POST, AND WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF OTHERS WOULD CHECK THE
FOLLOWUP FIELD WHEN POSTING ON THIS THREAD.

T.O HAS ITS *OWN* THINGS TO SHOUT POINTLESSLY ABOUT.
