#THIS IS COMPLETE NONSENSE.  RELATIVISM MEANS SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE
#STANDARD OF MORALITY; IT DOES NOT MEAN SAYING THAT ALL STANDARDS OF MORALITY
#ARE EQUALLY GOOD.

PRESUMABLY THIS MEANS THAT SOME MORAL SYSTEMS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS?
HOW SO?  HOW DO YOU MANAGE THIS WITHOUT AN OBJECTIVE FRAME OF REFERENCE?
AND WHAT WEASEL WORD DO YOU USE TO DESCRIBE THAT FRAME OF REFERENCE, IF
IT ISN'T AN OBJECTIVE REALITY FOR VALUES?
