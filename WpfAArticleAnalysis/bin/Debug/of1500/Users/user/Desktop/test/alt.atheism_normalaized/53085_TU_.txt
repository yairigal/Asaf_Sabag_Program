WELCOME ABOARD!

MOST RESPONSES WERE AGAINST HIS POSTINGS THAT SPOUTED THE FACT THAT
ALL ATHEISTS ARE FOOLS/EVIL FOR NOT SEEING HOW PEACHY ISLAM IS.
I WOULD LEAVE THE PRO/CON ARGUMENTS OF ISLAM TO FRED RICE, WHO IS MORE
LEVEL HEADED AND SEEMS TO KNOW MORE ON THE SUBJECT, ANYWAY.

HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO WELCOME YOU ABORD?!?
