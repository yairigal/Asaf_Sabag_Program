WELL, THAT GOT US A LONG WAY. NOW DEFINE "OBJECTIVE VALUE," AND
MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO _MORAL_ (NOT SCIENTIFIC) VALUES.

WHILE YOUR AT IT, TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF "OBJECTIVE" AND
"VALUES." IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DICTIONARY, I'VE WRITTEN THOSE DEFINITONS
IN A COUPLE OF RECENT POSTINGS.
