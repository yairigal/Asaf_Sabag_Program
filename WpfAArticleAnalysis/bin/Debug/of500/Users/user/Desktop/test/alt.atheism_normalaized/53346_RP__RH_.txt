Okay I see smilies so this isnt supposed to be a serious post 
On the other hand I would suppose it does has some motivation behind 
it Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion but there is  
presumably some sort of reasoning behind it As an argument this  
statement is worthless Presuming the Quran is a perfect religious  
text whatever that might be there is still plenty of room for  
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials 
 
Ive already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made 
between two people who in fact do disagree about Islam which doesnt 
presume anything about the Quran other than its having sufficient 
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of 
Islam This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have 
disagreements about all issues relevant to Islam
