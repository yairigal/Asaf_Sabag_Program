  THE RECENT RISE OF NOSTALGIA IN THIS GROUP, COMBINED WITH THE
  INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF UTTER BULLSHIT, HAS PROMPTED ME TO COMB
  THROUGH MY ARCHIVES AND PULL OUT SOME OF "THE BEST OF ALT.ATHEISM"
  FOR YOUR READING PLEASURE.  I'LL POST A COUPLE OF THESE A DAY
  UNLESS GROUP CONCENSUS DEMANDS THAT I STOP, OR I RUN OUT OF GOOD
  MATERIAL.

  I HAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY CAREFUL IN THE PAST ABOUT SAVING
  ATTRIBUTIONS.  I THINK THE FOLLOWING COMES FROM JOHN A. JOHNSON,
  BUT SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.  THIS IS PROBABLY THE LONGEST
  OF MY ENTIRE COLLECTION.

                                  PROPHECY BE
                                   FULFILLED

       IN CONSIDERING THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, AND JUDGING IT
ACCORDING TO ITS CLAIMS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT ITS CLAIMS AT
FULFILLING EARLIER JEWISH PROPHECY.  THE SCRIBE MATTHEW IS PERHAPS
THE MOST EAGER TO DRAW OUT WHAT HE THINKS ARE PROPHETIC ANSWERS IN
THE CAREER OF JESUS OF NAZARETH.  AS YOU WILL SEE, MATTHEW'S MAIN
STRATEGY IS TO TAKE VARIOUS OLD TESTAMENT PASSAGES, OFTEN NOT EVEN
ABOUT THE PROMISED MESSIAH, AND APPLY THEM TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
THE NEW TESTAMENT.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THE QUESTION OF THE
AUTHENTICITY OF THE ACCOUNTS.  SINCE THE GOSPELS WERE WRITTEN AT
LEAST 35 YEARS AFTER JESUS WAS EXECUTED, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH
HAPPENED EXACTLY AS STATED.  BUT, FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS, WE
WILL TAKE PARTICULAR CLAIMS AT FACE VALUE.

IMMANUEL:

       WE BEGIN, OF COURSE, AT THE BEGINNING.

       (MT 1.21-22):  "[MARY] WILL BEAR A SON, AND YOU,
       JOSEPH, WILL NAME HIM 'JESUS' (WHICH MEANS G'D IS
       SALVATION), FOR HE WILL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
       SINS."  ALL THIS HAPPENED TO FULFIL WHAT THE LORD HAD
       SPOKEN BY A PROPHET:

       [ISAIAH 7.1-16]:  IN THE DAYS OF
