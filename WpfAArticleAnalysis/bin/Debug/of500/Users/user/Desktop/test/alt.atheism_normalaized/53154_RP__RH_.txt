Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical 
and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates 
the groups from each other 
 
But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example 
of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon 
against other humans And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side 
it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors willing to use even 
Christianity as a weapon against their former friends
