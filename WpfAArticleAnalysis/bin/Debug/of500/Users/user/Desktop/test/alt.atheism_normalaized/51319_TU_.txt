>YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE WHAT BERNARD LEWIS WRITES ABOUT, LABEL HIM
>AS A ZIONIST OR SUCH TO DISCREDIT HIM ETC. 

YOU MISREPRESENT ME, SELIM.  THE HARD EVIDENCE FOR MY STATEMENTS ABOUT
HIS LACK OF OBJECTIVITY ARE PRESENTED QUITE CLEARLY IN THE BOOK
"ORIENTALISM" BY EDWARD SAID.  EDWARD SAID, BY THE WAY, IS A CHRISTIAN,
NOT A MUSLIM.

>I THINK HE IS
>PRETTY MUCH OBJECTIVE IN HIS TREATMENT IN "RACE AND SLAVERY IN
>THE MIDDLE EAST", SINCE HE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN
>SLAVERY UNDER ISLAM, AND THE PRACTICE OF SLAVERY IN OTHER COUNTRIES,
>LIKE THE US PRIOR TO THE CIVIL WAR. HE ALSO DOES NOT CONCEAL
>THAT THERE ARE VERSES IN THE QURAN WHICH PROMOTE THE LIBERATION
>OF SLAVES. WHAT HE DOESN'T, AND I DON'T THINK NOBODY CAN,
>DEDUCE FROM THESE VERSES IS THAT SLAVERY WILL EVENTUALLY BE
>ABOLISHED IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES. NOW YOU MIGHT, RATHER CONVENIENTLY,
>BLAME THE PRACTICE OF SLAVERY ON MUSLIMS, BUT THE FACTS ARE OUT
>THERE. I ALSO FAIL TO SEE THE RELEVANCE OF THE CLAIM OF LEWIS BEING
>A "ZIONIST" TO WHAT I WROTE. 

REGARDING BERNARD LEWIS:

HIM BEING A ZIONIST GIVES HIM A POLITICAL MOTIVE FOR HIS
GIVING MISREPRESENTATIONS AND HALF-TRUTHS ABOUT ISLAM.

READ "ORIENTALISM" BY EDWARD SAID -- SEE THE EVIDENCE FOR YOURSELF.

IN FACT, I MAY POST SOME OF IT HERE (IF IT ISN'T TOO LONG).

>THEY WERE ENCYCLOPAEDIC INFORMATION
>WHICH ANYBODY CAN ACCESS - THAT SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED AT CERTAIN
>DATES SOME 1200 YEARS AFTER MUHAMMED, THAT THIS WAS THE CAUSE
>OF TENSIONS IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE BETWEEN THE ARAB SLAVE TRADERS
>AND THE GOVERNMENT ETC.. WE ALSO HAVE IN THE ASU LIBRARY VOLUMES
>OF BRITISH DOCUMENTS ON SLAVERY WHERE REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS
>CONCERNING SLAVERY ALL AROUND THE WORLD CAN BE FOUND, WHICH I
>CHECKED SOME OF THE INCIDENTS LEWIS MENTIONS. SO I DON'T THINK
>ONES POLITICAL STANCE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.

I HAVEN'T READ LEWIS'S ARTICLE, SO I CAN'T COMMENT DIRECTLY UPON IT, AND
HAVE ONLY SPOKEN ABOUT HIS WRITINGS _IN GENERAL_ SO FAR, THAT HIS
POLITICAL MOTIVES MAKE HIM A BIASED WRITER ON ISLAM.  HIS ANTI-ISLAMIC
POLEMICS, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, ARE OFTEN QUITE SUBTLE AND ARE OFTEN BASED
ON TELLING HALF-TRUTHS.

AGAIN, READ "ORIENTALISM" BY EDWARD SAID.  I AM _NOT_ ASKING YOU TO TAKE
WHAT I SAY ON TRUST, IN FACT I AM URGING YOU NOT TO DO SO BUT TO GET
THIS BOOK (IT IS A WELL-KNOWN BOOK) AND CHECK THE EVIDENCE OUT FOR
_YOURSELF_.

>THE ISSUE I RAISED WAS THAT SLAVES WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES,
>WHEN IT WAS CLAIMED THAT ISLAM PROHIBITS EXTRA-MARITAL SEX.
>I WROTE THAT THE PROPHET HIMSELF HAD CONCUBINES, I WROTE AN
>INCIDENT IN WHICH THE PROPHET ADVISED ON SOMEONE WHO DID NOT
>WANT HIS CONCUBINE TO GET PREGNANT ETC., WHICH IS CONTRARY
>TO THE NOTION THAT "SEX IS FOR PROCREATION ONLY". IN OTHER
>WORDS, SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASELESS IN THE QURAN AND THE HADITH.

IF SLAVERY IS _IN REALITY_ (AS OPPOSED TO IN THE PRACTICE OF SOME
MUSLIMS) OPPOSED BY ISLAM, THEN
