You can tell your friend from me that I was in a publishers 
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of The Joy of 
Cooking and every one of them was syllableperfect 
 
I have since sold all I own and become a follower of The Joy 
of Cooking  The incident I mentioned convinced me once and 
for all that The Joy of Cooking is inspired by god and the 
one true path to his glory
