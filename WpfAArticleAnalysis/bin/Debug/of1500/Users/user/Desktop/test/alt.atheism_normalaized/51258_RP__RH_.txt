	Please define morally straight  
 
	 
	 
	And dont even try saying that straight as it is used here  
implies only hetersexual behavior  eg straight as in the slang word  
opposite to gay  
 
 
	This is alot like family values Everyone is talking about them  
but misteriously no one knows what they are 
 
 
        One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that  
        say Mom because of the love of their mom  It makes for more  
        virile men
