Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged 
more than once When I did it you said good question and did not 
address it 
 
Ive addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless 
to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with  
Eric Rescorla

You still repeat that point 
 
I do Curious since I believe that was the first time Ive ever made it 
Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability 
to understand you ask me the same question Ill give you the same 
answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true  I 
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is 
making the same points and Im pushed for time then I try to respond what I  
believe are the strongest formulations of those points  If that doesnt 
include your post tough this is USENET and life is tough all over

You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others You appear 
with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning 
again 
 
Ive only debated this issue twice in aa and occasionally in ta  The 
first was in response to Simon Clippingdales positive assertion that 
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals 
are relative  It doesnt   Now Simon has dropped out of the debate 
for some time I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored 
with the topic  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty  Do you  
 
>d I cant always understand what you say 
  
Neither cant I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other 
side means 
 
Usually one does  Usually youre clear but sometimes you arent  
and I ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight  
and I feel that Im debating against line noise  Sometimes I get tired and  
sometimes I have other things Id rather do  Again this is USENET and 
life is tough all over  Youre going to have to deal with it 
 
>e Youre starting to get personally insulting I may not even put your name 
>    in the hat in future 
 
Thats supposed to be a threat 
 
No thats a simple statement and an assertion that I am not answerable 
to those who offer me baseless insults  For example those who accuse me  
of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that I dont answer 
their questions

is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often 
And then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it 
is there unless evidence against it has been found 
 
I have no problem with the second statement  I have provided an 
argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable  the 
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered 
by some other people too essentially that people disagree about 
fuzzy concepts such as Freedom  Its a good point and Im thinking 
about it 
  
Your trick is to say I feel A is not right and so do many I know 
therefore A is absolutely right It neglects the possibility that 
these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process 
restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject 
of that process In other words refutes it You make the ontological 
claim you have to prove it 
 
Nonsense  My trick is to say  I feel that A is better than B and so  
does almost any disinterested person I ask  Best evidence is therefore  
that A really is better than B subject to the assumption that we 
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and 
that the resulting system of values is selfconsistent 
 
Now get this  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model 
in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model It 
may or may not correspond to something true  It is nonetheless a useful 
assumption  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  
trick to wit 
 
I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person 
I ask  However if even one person disagrees that A is better than B 
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B 
then it is the case that B is better than A for that person and nothing 
more can be said   
 
I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority 
seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to 
maximise B eg a terrorist  To do that would be to claim that  
a supermajoritys carefully considered morality would be better than the  
terrorists  which would of course be true but a nono for an ethical 
relativist  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is 
simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival 
anything in the world of religion

It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to 
judgements is absolute And as long as you dont provide evidence for 
that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to 
believe your hypothesis 
 
Ive done this freedom with the proviso that I still have to  
answer jons objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no 
objective meaning 
 
Further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective 
you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes 
above look quite misleading 
 
Not really  What evidence is there that anything exists independently 
of humans  Youll be hard pressed to find any that isnt logically 
equivalent when applied to values

No Morals are a matter of belief so far The people still believe that the 
shortest way is through the
