OH, YOUR HIGHNESS?   AND EXACTLY WHY "SHOULD" THE QUOTATION
MARKS ENCLOSE "LAWS," NOT "MUST."

PERHAPS THE CHIMPS THAT FAILED TO EVOLVE COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR
DIED OUT, AND WE ARE LEFT WITH THE ONES THAT DID EVOLVE SUCH
BEHAVIOUR, ENTIRELY BY CHANCE.

ARE YOU GOING TO PROCLAIM A NATURAL MORALITY EVERY TIME AN
ORGANISM EVOLVES COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR?
