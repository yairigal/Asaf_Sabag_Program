#> SPECIFICALLY, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT RELATIVISM CONCLUDES WHEN TWO
#> PEOPLE GROTESQUELY DISAGREE.  IS IT:
#> 
#> (A) BOTH ARE RIGHT
#> 
#> (B) ONE OF THEM IS WRONG, AND SOMETIMES (THOUGH PERHAPS RARELY) WE HAVE A 
#>     PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO IT IS
#> 
#> (C) ONE OF THEM IS WRONG, BUT WE NEVER HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHO, SO
#>     WE MAKE OUR BEST GUESS IF WE REALLY MUST MAKE A DECISION.
#> 
#> (D) THE IDEA OF A "RIGHT" MORAL JUDGEMENT IS MEANINGLESS (IMPLYING THAT
#>      WHETHER PEACE IS BETTER THAN WAR, E.G., IS A MEANINGLESS QUESTION,
#>      AND NEED NOT BE DISCUSSED FOR IT HAS NO CORRECT ANSWER)
#> 
#> (E) SOMETHING ELSE.  A SHORT, POSITIVE ASSERTION WOULD BE NICE.
#
#FROM WHOSE POINT OF VIEW WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT RELATIVISM CONCLUDES? 
#ONE OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ARGUMENT, OR SOME THIRD PERSON OBSERVING
#THE ARGUERS?

I'VE JUST COME FROM RESPONDING ANOTHER OF YOUR POSTS, WHERE SOME PENNIES
HAVE DROPPED FOR ME.  BUT IT WOULD CLARIFY FURTHER IF YOU WOULD ANSWER
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ANY DISINTERESTED OBSERVERS - PERHAPS AN
OBSERVER AS LIKELY TO BE IN POSITION A AS IN POSITION B (WHERE A AND B
DISAGREE) IN THE FUTURE, AND HAVE HIS OR HER CONCLUSION NOW BINDING ON
THEM AT THAT TIME.
