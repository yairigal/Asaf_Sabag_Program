#>TRUE, BUT NEVERTHELESS THE BASIS OF ALL "MATTERS OF FACT" IS OVERWHELMING
#>POPULAR OPINION, AND SOME OVERWHELMING POPULAR OPINION *IS* FACT ("THE
#>SUN SHINES").  IF IT WERE NOT SO, PHYSICS WOULD BE A PERSONAL MATTER,
#>ASSUMED TO BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH OF US.  THERE WOULD BE YOURGRAVITY AND
#>MYGRAVITY AND NO THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO ENCOMPASS THEM AND PREDICT
#>BOTH.  
#THIS IS SIMPLY COMPLETE NONSENSE. THE BASIS FOR 'MATTERS OF FACT' IS,
#IF ANY CLASS OF OPINION, THE MAJORITY OF INFORMED POPULAR OPINION
#FOR SOME VALUE OF INFORMED. I WOULD REALLY HATE TO BASE MY KNOWLEDGE
#OF, FOR INSTANCE, QM ON WHAT THE OVERWHELMING POPULAR OPINION IS.

THE *BASIS*, ERIC, IS PEOPLE PEERING AT THE WORLD AND SAYING WHAT
THEY SEE.  I'M TALKING ABOUT UNINTERPRETED FACTS - OBSERVATIONS.  _PEOPLE_
DO THOSE.  AGREEMENT ON SOME OBSERVATIONS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR A THEORY
THAT IS MORE THAN PERSONAL.

#>ABOUT *RAW* OBSERVATIONS ("THE DIAL READS 1.2") MATTER, IN OTHER WORDS, THOUGH 
#>THEY CAN SURELY BE MISTAKEN (OR EVEN LYING) THERE TOO ("I SAW THE STATUE 
#>MOVE!").  GETTING TO THEORIES FROM RAW FACTS IS CERTAINLY ERROR-PRONE, BUT
#>ONE ASSUMES THAT THE RAW FACTS ARE USUALLY AS REPORTED, OTHERWISE SCIENCE
#>IS IMPOSSIBLE.  
#OPINIONS ABOUT 'RAW FACTS' AS YOU CALL THEM ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT
#THAN INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE RAW FACTS.

I KNOW THIS.  YOU KNOW THIS.  CAN WE PROCEED?

#>NOW I TAKE AN EXPERIENCE OF GOOD/EVIL TO BE EVERY BIT AS RAW A FACT AS AN
#>EXPERIENCE OF PAIN, OR VISION.
#THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A GOOD FIRST PASS GUESS, BUT IT TURNS OUT TO
#BE A PRETTY CRUDDY WAY TO LOOK AT THINGS, BECAUSE WE ALL SEEM TO
#HAVE RATHER DIFFERENT OPINIONS (EXPERIENCES) ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD
#AND EVIL, WHILE WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO AGREE ON WHAT THE METER SAYS.

YOU'RE NOT COMPARING APPLES WITH APPLES.  IF WE ALL LOOK AT THE SAME METER,
WE'LL AGREE.  IF WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME SITUATION, THAT'S WHEN WE'LL
AGREE ON FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, IF AT ALL.  PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT NOBODY AGREES ON
VALUES TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT THEY AGREE ON TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS SEEM
TO BE UNAWARE OF THE EXTENT OF AGREEMENT ON EITHER.
