BOBBY, THERE'S A QUESTION HERE THAT I JUST HAVE TO ASK. IF ALL
OF YOUR POSTS AREN'T SOME SORT OF EXTENDED, ELABORATE HOAX, WHY
ARE YOU TRYING SO HARD TO CONVINCE THE ENTIRE CIVILISED WORLD
THAT YOU'RE FEEBLE MINDED? YOU HAVE A TALENT FOR SAYING THE MOST
ABSURD THINGS. HERE'S A LITTLE SIGN FOR YOU, PRINT IT, CUT IT OUT
AND PUT IT ON TOP OF YOUR COMPUTER/TERMINAL.

              ENGAGE BRAIN PRIOR TO OPERATING KEYBOARD


(HAVING SAID ALL THAT, I MUST ADMIT WE ALL GET A LAUGH FROM
YOUR STUFF.)
