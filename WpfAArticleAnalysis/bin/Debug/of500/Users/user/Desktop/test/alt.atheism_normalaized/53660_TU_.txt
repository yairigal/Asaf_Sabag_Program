IF THE FIRST RULE OF HUMOR IS NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY THEN THE 
SECOND RULE MUST BE NEVER HAVING TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.  FEW THINGS ARE 
WORSE THAT A JOKE EXPLAINED.  IN SPITE OF THIS, AND BECAUSE OF REQUESTS
FOR ME TO POST MY LIST O' NICKNAMES, I MUST ADMIT THAT NO SUCH LIST
EXISTS.  IT WAS SIMPLY A PLOT DEVICE, ALONG WITH ME BEING THE KEEPER
O' THE LIST, TO MAKE THE OBVIOUS PLAY ON THE LAST NAME OF FULLER AND TO
ADVANCE THE IDEA THAT SUCH A LIST SHOULD BE MADE.

I ASSUMED THAT THE OL' TIMERS WOULD RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS.  
NEVERTHELESS, HOW ABOUT A LIST O' NICKNAMES FOR ALT.ATHEISM POSTERS?
IF YOU THINK OF A GOOD ONE, JUST POST IT AND SEE IF OTHERS LIKE IT.
WE COULD START WITH THOSE POSTERS WHO ANNOY US THE MOST, LIKE BOBBY OR
BILL.
