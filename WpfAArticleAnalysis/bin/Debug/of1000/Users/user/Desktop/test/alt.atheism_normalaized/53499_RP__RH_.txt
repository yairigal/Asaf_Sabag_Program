Kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little 
about algorithms Your reasoning as I see it is very much along the 
lines of Roger Penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot 
be algorithmic in his book The emperors new mind Concerning 
computers minds and the laws of physics However Penroses 
claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim 
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look 
could be just illusions 
 
We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints  I try to ponder 
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective 
realising that it might not be anything special but certainly 
useful Thinking back of what I wrote do you think worms have minds 
or not They are able to experience pain at least they behave  
just like that Yet it is conceivable that we might some day 
in the future perform a total synthesis of C elegans from 
the elements Would such a worm have a mind

This is true to some extent However I do not think that our brains 
work like computers at all In fact there is substantial evidence 
Skarda 1985 Skarda  Freeman 1987 that brains work more or less 
chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve 
Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators I suppose

Indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture 
on our mind and brain I suggest however that before trying to 
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms  
 
Kevin take a look at the references I mentioned and think again 
I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind 
are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not  
flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are 
conscious  
 
The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot 
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different 
 
And please do not bring QM into this discussion at all  not 
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness 
plays some special role in physics I would say it doesnt

Again brains are not computers Dont forget this This does not 
mean they need something else to work  they just work differently 
Their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action  
selfawareness and high intelligence are later appearances

You are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in 
our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical This is 
not how I see it The sensation green is a certain timedependent 
pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex and it is distributed 
with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain  
 
Indeed a firing pattern I have sometimes thought of our consciousness 
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns 
but this is just idle speculation 
 
Scientific Americans September 1992 issue was a special issue on 
mind and brain Have you already read it from cover to cover  
There are two articles on visual perception so you might be  
interested 
 
But again please note that subjective experiences cannot be  
observed from a thirdperson perspective If we see nothing but  
neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the 
mind 
 
Kalat 1988 writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation 
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  
patients state of mind For instance a patient whose septal area 
was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during 
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and 
started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend 
 
Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing 
situations when the patients have started flirting with the 
therapist 
 
In conclusion there is evidence that 
 
1 brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences
