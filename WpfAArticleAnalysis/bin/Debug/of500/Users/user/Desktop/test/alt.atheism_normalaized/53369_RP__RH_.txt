In what manner  If you argue that the universe was created with a higher 
truth than science btw I would love to see you define truth in this 
arguement then you must state how you know this and what it is  To subbornly 
state that there is a higher truth and that it isyour god I would ask you to prove it 
This obviously you cannot do  Besides if I assume for the moment that 
there is a higher truth then how can you prove it is your god and not  
another religions  What makes you so arrogant to push forward your idea 
of creation over many peoples study of the laws of nature ie science 
 
Science is the study of nature  It is openminded if the theory doesnt fit the 
facts then trash the theory and try to construct one which does  It is *flexible* 
Your definition of science presupposes that science ignores this god  
character altogether  If this is so then it is only because no evidence  
can be found of him 
 
|>  By the way I enjoy science 
 
So do I  Fortunately I am not mentally shackled into constructing my 
scientific conclusions by placing god Jesus and the holy ghost into every 
paragraph in a sycophantic manner

Indeed it is a wonder observing the random effects of creation  This of 
course assumes a definition of aethetics which you dont forward 
 
 
As to Macroevolution  please give references and more information  From 
where do you get your figures
