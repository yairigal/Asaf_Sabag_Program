I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we 
take the appellation Rabbi seriously then Jesus had a full 
grasp of contemporary scripture 
 
Mat2142 Jesus saith unto them Did ye never read in the scriptures 
 
Mat2229 Jesus answered and said unto them Ye do err not knowing 
Mat2229 the scriptures nor the power of God 
 
Following from this he would have been in a wonderful 
position to fulfil prophesies and the NT says as much 
 
Mat2654 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled 
Mat2654 that thus it must be 
 
Mat2656 But all this was done that the scriptures of the 
Mat2656 prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples 
Mat2656 forsook him and fled 
 
If the books comprising the referredto scripture had not 
been accessible then it probably would be a different 
matter
