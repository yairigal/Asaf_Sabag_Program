You misrepresent me Selim  The hard evidence for my statements about 
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book 
Orientalism by Edward Said  Edward Said by the way is a Christian 
not a Muslim 
 
>I think he is

>deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be 
>abolished in Islamic countries Now you might rather conveniently

Regarding Bernard Lewis 
 
Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his 
giving misrepresentations and halftruths about Islam 
 
Read Orientalism by Edward Said  see the evidence for yourself 
 
In fact I may post some of it here if it isnt too long 
 
>They were encyclopaedic information 
>which anybody can access  that slavery was abolished at certain 
>dates some 1200 years after Muhammed that this was the cause

>and the government etc We also have in the ASU library volumes 
>of British documents on slavery where reports and documents 
>concerning slavery all around the world can be found which I 
>checked some of the incidents Lewis mentions So I dont think 
>ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence 
 
I havent read Lewiss article so I cant comment directly upon it and 
have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his 
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam  His antiIslamic 
polemics as I understand it are often quite subtle and are often based 
on telling halftruths 
 
Again read Orientalism by Edward Said  I am not asking you to take 
what I say on trust in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get 
this book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for 
yourself 
 
>The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES 
>when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extramarital sex 
>I wrote that the Prophet himself
