This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolute 
standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality 
are equally good 
 
Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others 
How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference 
And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if 
it isnt an objective reality for values
