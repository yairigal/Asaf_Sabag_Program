I AM DOING RESEARCH ON ATHEISM, PART OF WHICH INVOLVES FIELD RESEARCH HERE
ON THE NET.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SURVEY DIRECTED TOWARDS ALL READERS OF THIS
GROUP, INTENDED TO GET DATA ABOUT THE BASIS OF ATHEISTIC BELIEF.  I WOULD
SERIOUSLY APPRECIATE IT IF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU WOULD FILL IT OUT AND
MAIL IT BACK TO ME AT MTABBOTT@UNIX.AMHERST.EDU.  

FIRST OF ALL, I'VE TRIED TO STRUCTURE QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED IN A
VARIETY OF WAYS, WITH VARYING AMOUNTS OF DETAIL; IT'S POSSIBLE TO GIVE 
SUCCINCT ANSWERS TO MOST EVERYTHING, BUT THERE'S ENOUGH HERE TO KEEP MOST OF 
YOU TYPING FOR HOURS, I'M SURE.  AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WANT TO GIVE ME (I MEAN 
IT) IS GREAT, BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE AS BROAD A BASE OF 
INDIVIDUALS AS POSSIBLE, SO EVEN MINIMAL RESPONSES ARE FAR BETTER THAN NOTHING
-- IT'S A SHORT SURVEY IF YOU JUST ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WITHOUT ELABORATION.  

SECONDLY, I HOPE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS DON'T COME OFF AS OBNOXIOUS; I KNOW THAT
PHRASES LIKE "WHAT WOULD CONVINCE YOU OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" IMPLY THAT I AM
A SEMINARY STUDENT INTENT ON PROVING YOU ALL TO BE IGNORANT GODLESS HEATHENS.
IN FACT, I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A HIGHER POWER MYSELF, SO MY
USE OF "GOD" IS A QUESTION OF LOCUTION RATHER THAN IDEOLOGY -- IT'S EASIER 
THAN JUST REPEATING "A DEITY OR HIGHER POWER" EVERY TIME.  

ALSO, I TEND TO USE A LOT OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL BUZZWORDS LIKE "BELIEF SYSTEM"
ALTHOUGH I KNOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT CONTEND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BELIEFS, BUT
ARE SKEPTICAL TOWARDS EVERYTHING.  I UNDERSTAND; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
THINK OF SUCH BUZZWORDS AS ABBREVIATIONS FOR THE RATHER UNWEILDY PHRASES 
REQUIRED TO GET THE PRECISE IDEA ACROSS.  

LASTLY, THANKS!  PLEASE FILL OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS
YOU CAN, AND SEND THEM TO ME.  MY RESEARCH AND I THANK YOU.

WHERE WOULD YOU PLACE YOUR BELIEFS, ON THE SPECTRUM 
	THEISM <--> AGNOSTICISM <--> WEAK ATHEISM <--> STRONG ATHEISM?  
FEEL FREE TO ELABORATE ON YOUR SPECIFIC BELIEFS.  


IN WHAT, IF ANY, RELIGIOUS TRADITION WERE YOU RAISED?  DID YOU EVER BELIEVE 
IN THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD?  (SEVERAL OF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS PRESUME 
THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS IS "YES;" IF YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ATHEIST, OR AT
LEAST NEVER A THEIST, YOU MAY HAVE TO MODIFY THE QUESTION/ANSWER SOMEWHAT.)


HOW SERIOUS WAS YOUR/YOUR FAMILY'S INVOLVEMENT?  

HOW AND WHEN DID YOU START TO DOUBT THE TENETS YOU WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE?  

HOW AND WHEN DID YOUR "FINAL BREAK" WITH YOUR BELIEFS, IF ANY, OCCUR?  I 
REALIZE THAT THIS IS OFTEN MORE OF AN ONGOING PROCESS THAN AN "EVENT" PER SE;
WHATEVER THE CASE, JUST DESCRIBE IT IN WHATEVER DETAIL YOU WISH.
