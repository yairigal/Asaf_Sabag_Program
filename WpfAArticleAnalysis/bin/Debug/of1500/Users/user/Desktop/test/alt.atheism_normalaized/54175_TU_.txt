I AND MANY OTHERS ON A.A HAVE DESCRIBED HOW WE HAVE TRIED TO FIND GOD.
ARE YOU SAYING OUR EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN SINCERE?  FOR ALL THE EFFORT
I HAVE PUT IN, THERE HAS BEEN NO OUTWARD NOR INWARD CHANGE THAT I CAN
PERCEIVE.  WHAT'S A SINCERELY SEARCHING AGNOSTIC OR ATHEIST SUPPOSED TO
DO WHEN EVEN THE SEARCH TURNS UP NOTHING?

HOW DO YOU "ACCEPT THAT WHICH YOU DON'T KNOW"?  DO YOU MEAN THAT I MUST
BELIEVE IN YOUR GOD IN ORDER TO BELIEVE IN YOUR GOD?
