CHARLEY,

I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE STILL FAILED TO PROVIDE ANSWERS
TO SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN RESPONSE TO YOUR
PREVIOUS POSTS.  I SUBMIT THAT YOU DON'T ANSWER THEM BECAUSE YOU
CANNOT ANSWER THEM WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF YOUR OWN LOGIC, AND I ONCE
AGAIN CHALLENGE YOU TO PROVE ME WRONG.  TO MAKE THE TASK AS EASY FOR
YOU AS POSSIBLE, I'LL PRESENT CONCISE RE-STATEMENTS OF SOME OF THE
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FAILED TO ANSWER, IN THE HOPE THAT YOU MAY
ADDRESS THEM ONE AT A TIME FOR ALL TO SEE.

SHOULD YOU FAIL TO ANSWER AGAIN WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD, I
WILL RE-POST THIS ARTICLE, WITH SUITABLE ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS, AT
SUCH TIME THAT I NOTICE A POST BY YOU ON ANOTHER TOPIC.  I WILL REPEAT
THIS PROCEDURE UNTIL YOU EITHER ADDRESS THE OUTSTANDING CHALLENGES OR
YOU CEASE TO POST TO THIS NEWSGROUP.

I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF YOU HAVE ANSWERED ANY OF THESE
QUESTIONS PREVIOUSLY AND YOUR ANSWER MISSED MY NOTICE.  IF YOU CAN BE
KIND ENOUGH TO RE-POST OR E-MAIL SUCH ARTICLES, I WILL BE ONLY TOO
PLEASED TO PUBLICLY RESCIND THE CHALLENGE IN QUESTION, AND REMOVE IT
FROM THIS LIST.

NOW, TO THE QUESTIONS...

1. AFTER CLAIMING THAT ALL ATHEISTS FIT INTO NEAT PSYCHOLOGICAL
PATTERNS THAT YOU PROPOSED, THEN SEMI-RETRACTING THAT CLAIM BY STATING
THAT YOU WEREN'T REFERRING TO *ALL* ATHEISTS, I ASKED YOU TO NAME SOME
ATHEISTS WHO YOU FEEL DON'T FIT YOUR PATTERNS, TO SHOW THAT YOU INDEED
WERE NOT REFERRING TO ALL ATHEISTS THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF.  YOU FAILED
TO DO SO.  PLEASE DO SO NOW.

QUESTION: CAN YOU NAME ANY A.A POSTERS WHO DO NOT FIT INTO YOUR
STEREOTYPE?

HERE IS THE CONTEXT FOR THE QUESTION:

>>> THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE ON THIS BOARD, AND YOU ARE OUT OF LINE
>>> IN ASSUMING THAT IT IS.
>>
>>YOU, HOWEVER, DELETED THE TEXT FURTHER ALONG WHERE I SAID THAT I DIDN'T MEAN
>>TO IMPLY THAT EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCE WAS ALONG THE SAME LINES.  
>
>WHETHER OR NOT YOU *MEAN* TO MAKE SUCH IMPLICATIONS, YOU DO SO
>REPEATEDLY.  
>
>ALLOW ME TO APPROACH THE ISSUE FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINT: CAN YOU NAME
>THOSE ATHEISTS THAT YOU'VE COME ACROSS WHO *DO NOT* FIT INTO THE
>PATTERNS THAT YOU THEORIZE?


2. YOU HAVE TAKEN UMBRAGE TO STATEMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT "SENSES AND
REASON ARE ALL WE
