Apparently not 
 
In response to his claim that it terrifies gay people not to be able 
to indoctrinate children to our lifestyle or words to that effect 
I sent Roger a very calm carefullywritten detailed letter 
explaining simply why the BSA policy does indeed terrify me  I did 
not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an 
answer  Thus far I have not received an answer  I can conclude only 
that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not 
worth defending

In fact thats exactly the point people can control their behavior 
Because of that fact there is no need for a blanket ban on 
homosexuals 
 
>What else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue 
 
You tell me
