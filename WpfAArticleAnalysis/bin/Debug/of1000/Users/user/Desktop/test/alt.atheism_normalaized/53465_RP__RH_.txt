Good statement Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact 
social morals Should morals be based on social rules On ancient 
religious doctrines It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single 
denominator for defining morals and as such defining absolute 
and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have  
this incredible talent of creative thinking
