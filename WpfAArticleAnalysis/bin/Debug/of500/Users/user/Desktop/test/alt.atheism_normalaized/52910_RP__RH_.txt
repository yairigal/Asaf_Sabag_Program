Welcome to altatheism and altatheismmoderated 
 
This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the 
newsgroups 
 
Many groups of a controversial nature have noticed that new readers often 
come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post 
them to the net  In addition people often request information which has 
been posted time and time again  In order to try and cut down on this the 
altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following 
titles 
 
   1  AltAtheism FAQ Overview for New Readers 
   2  AltAtheism FAQ Introduction to Atheism 
   3  AltAtheism FAQ Frequently Asked Questions FAQ 
   4  AltAtheism FAQ Constructing a Logical Argument 
   5  AltAtheism FAQ Atheist Resources
