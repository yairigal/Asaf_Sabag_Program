THAT ("COMPLICATED") ISN'T IN FACT WHERE P(H) > P(HG) COMES FROM; IT'S MORE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND. IT'S FROM

  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  WHERE G' IS THE COMPLEMENT OF G

AND BY AXIOM, P(ANYTHING) >= 0, SO P(HG') >= 0, SO P(H) >= P(HG).

IN A SENSE, HG IS NECESSARILY MORE "COMPLICATED" THAN H FOR ANY H AND G,
SO I MAY BE SPLITTING HAIRS, BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IRRESPECTIVE
OF SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS OF HOW COMPLICATED SOMETHING IS, P(H) >= P(HG)
HOLDS, WITH EQUALITY IF AND ONLY IF P(HG') = 0.

WELL, "P(X | A) = P(X | B)" MEANS THAT X IS AS LIKELY TO BE OBSERVED IF A IS
OPERATIVE AS IT IS IF B IS OPERATIVE. THIS IMPLIES THAT OBSERVING X DOES NOT
PROVIDE ANY USEFUL INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT ALLOW US TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN
THE RESPECTIVE POSSIBILITIES THAT A AND B ARE OPERATIVE; THE DIFFERENCE
REDUCES TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE (UNKNOWN AND UNHELPFUL) PRIOR
PROBABILITIES P(A) AND P(B):

  P(X | A) = P(X | B)  ==>

    P(A | X)  =  K P(A),   AND   P(B | X)  =  K P(B)

WHERE K  =  P(X | A) / P(X)  =  P(X | B) / P(X).

SO A AND B ARE "EQUALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA" IN THAT OBSERVING X
DOESN'T GIVE ANY POINTERS AS TO WHICH OF A OR B IS OPERATIVE.

IN THE PARTICULAR CASE WHERE A = H AND B = HG, HOWEVER, WE KNOW THAT THEIR
PRIOR PROBABILITIES ARE ORDERED BY P(H) >= P(HG), ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW
THE ACTUAL VALUES, AND IT'S THIS WHICH ALLOWS US TO DEPLOY THE RAZOR TO
THROW OUT ANY SUCH HG.

THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE, BUT THE PARTICULAR POINT HERE WAS WHETHER OR
NOT A `DIVINE COMPONENT' ACTUALLY UNDERLIES THE PREVALENCE OF RELIGION
IN ADDITION TO THE MEMETIC TRANSMISSION COMPONENT, WHICH EVEN THE RELIGIOUS
IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE OPERATIVE WHEN THEY TALK OF `SPREADING THE WORD'.

NOW IT SEEMS TO ME, AS I'VE SAID, THAT THE OBSERVED VARIANCE IN RELIGIOUS
BELIEF IS WELL ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE MEMETIC TRANSMISSION MODEL, BUT RATHER
*LESS* WELL IF ONE PROPOSES A `DIVINE COMPONENT' IN ADDITION, SINCE I WOULD
EXPECT THE LATTER TO CONSPIRE *AGAINST* WIDE VARIANCE AND EVEN MUTUAL
EXCLUSION AMONG BELIEFS. THUS MY *PERSONAL* FEELING IS THAT P(X | HG) ISN'T
EVEN EQUAL TO P(X | H) IN THIS CASE, BUT IS SMALLER (H IS MEMETIC TRANSMISSION,
G IS `DIVINE COMPONENT', X IS THE VARIANCE AMONG BELIEFS). BUT I HAPPILY
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSION.

NOT THAT I'M A STATISTICIAN AS SUCH EITHER, BUT:

THE IDEA IS THAT BOTH THEISM AND ATHEISM ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OF
THE (READ `MY') OBSERVATIONS TO DATE. HOWEVER, THEISM (OF THE TYPE WITH
WHICH I AM CONCERNED) *ALSO* SUGGESTS THAT, FOR INSTANCE, PRAYER MAY BE
ANSWERED, PEOPLE MAY BE MIRACULOUSLY HEALED (BOTH ARE IN PRINCIPLE AMENABLE
TO STATISTICAL VERIFICATION) AND THAT GOD/S MAY GENERALLY INTERVENE IN
MEASURABLE WAYS.

THIS MEANS THAT THESE REGIONS OF THE SPACE OF POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONS, 
WHICH I LOOSELY TERMED "APPEARANCES OF GOD/S", HAVE SOME NONZERO
PROBABILITY UNDER THE THEISTIC HYPOTHESIS AND ZERO UNDER THE ATHEISTIC.

SINCE THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH PROBABILITY AVAILABLE FOR EACH HYPOTHESIS TO
SCATTER AROUND OVER THE OBSERVATION SPACE, THE PROBABILITY WHICH THEISM
EXPENDS ON MAKING "APPEARANCES OF GOD/S" POSSIBLE MUST COME FROM SOMEWHERE
ELSE (I.E. OTHER POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONS).

ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL, THIS MEANS THAT AN OBSERVATION WHICH *ISN'T* AN
"APPEARANCE OF GOD/S" MUST HAVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROBABILITY UNDER
ATHEISM THAN UNDER THEISM. THE BAYESIAN STUFF IMPLIES THAT SUCH
OBSERVATIONS MUST CAUSE MY RUNNING ESTIMATE FOR THE PROBABILITY OF
THE ATHEISTIC HYPOTHESIS TO INCREASE, WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE
IN MY RUNNING ESTIMATE FOR THE PROBABILITY OF THE THEISTIC HYPOTHESIS.

SORRY IF THAT'S STILL A BIT JARGONESQUE, BUT IT'S RATHER DIFFICULT TO
PUT IT ANY OTHER WAY, SINCE IT DOES DEPEND INTIMATELY ON THE PROPERTIES
OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY DENSITIES, AND PARTICULARLY THAT THE TOTAL
AREA UNDER THEM IS ALWAYS UNITY.

AN ANALOGY MAY (OR MAY NOT :-) BE HELPFUL. SAY THAT HYPOTHESIS A IS "THE
COIN IS FAIR", AND THAT B IS "THE COIN IS UNFAIR (TWO-HEADED)". (I'VE
USED A AND B TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH H[HEADS] AND T[TAILS].)

THEN

  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  TOTAL 1
