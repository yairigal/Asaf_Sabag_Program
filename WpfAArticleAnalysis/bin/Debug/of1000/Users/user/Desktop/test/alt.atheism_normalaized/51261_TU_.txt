FOR ME, IT IS A "I BELIEVE NO GODS EXIST" AND A "I DON'T BELIEVE GODS EXIST".
 
IN OTHER WORDS, I THINK THAT STATEMENTS LIKE GODS ARE OR SOMEHOW INTERFERE
WITH THIS WORLD ARE FALSE OR MEANINGLESS. IN ONTOLOGY, ONE CAN FAIRLY
CONCLUDE THAT WHEN "A EXIST" IS MEANINGLESS A DOES NOT EXIST. UNDER THE
PRAGMATIC DEFINITION OF TRUTH, "A EXISTS" IS MEANINGLESS MAKES A EXIST
EVEN LOGICALLY FALSE.
 
A PROBLEM WITH SUCH STATEMENTS IS THAT ONE CAN'T DISPROVE A SUBJECTIVE GOD
BY DEFINITION, AND THERE MIGHT BE CASES WHERE A SUBJECTIVE GOD WOULD EVEN
MAKE SENSE. THE TROUBLE WITH MOST GOD DEFINITIONS IS THAT THEY INCLUDE
SOME FORM OF OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE GODS AFFECTING
ALL. BELIEVERS DERIVE FROM IT A RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH THE LIFE OF OTHERS.

HONESTLY, I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.
