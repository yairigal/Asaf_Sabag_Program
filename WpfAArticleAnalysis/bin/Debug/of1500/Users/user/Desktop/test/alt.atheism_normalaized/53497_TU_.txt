ABSTRACT AND THE CLEAR
- DISCUSSION OF THE ABROGATOR AND THE ABROGATED

THE PRINCIPLES OF APPLICATION OF THE LAW INVOLVES:
- PRINCIPLES OF EXEMPTION
- PRINCIPLES OF PRECAUTION
- PRINCIPLES OF OPTION
- PRINCIPLES OF MASTERY

THE JURISPRUDENT IS BOUND TO GO THROUGH A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS
IN PRONOUNCING JUDGEMENT ON A GIVEN SITUATION. IT IS NOT A MATTER
OF LOOKING AT ONE VERSE AND ONE HADITH. 

NOW NO ONE SHOULD BLINDLY FOLLOW ANYONE, BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BLIND FOLLOWING AND ACCEDING TO THE OPINION OF SOMEONE WHO IS
CLEARLY MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE QUALIFIED THAN ONESELF. THERE IS THE
FAMOUS HADITH OF THE PROPHET (S.A.) IN WHICH HE SAYS:
"THE FUQAHA (RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS) ARE THE TRUSTEES OF THE PROPHET, AS 
LONG AS THEY DO NOT CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE ILLICIT DESIRES, PLEASURES,
AND WEALTH OF THIS WORLD." THE PROPHET (S.A.) WAS ASKED: "O MESSENGER
OF GOD! HOW MAY WE KNOW IF THEY SO CONCERN THEMSELVES?" HE (S.A.) REPLIED:
"BY SEEING WHETHER THEY FOLLOW THE RULING POWER. IF THEY DO THAT, FEAR FOR
YOUR RELIGION AND SHUN THEM." I DO NOT YET KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE IMAMS
OF THE FOUR SUNNI MADHABS TO COMMENT ON HOW THIS HADITH APPLIES
TO THEM OR TO THE CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARS WHO BASE THEMSELVES UPON THEM.

THE PROPHET ALSO REFERED TO THE FUQAHA AS "THE FORTRESS OF ISLAM". MY ONLY
POINT IS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ARRIVING AT A LEGAL JUDGEMENT CALLS INTO
PLAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE - THE SPECIFICS OF THIS EXPERTISE IS 
DELINEATED IN THE QUR'AN AND HADITH. THOSE WHO ACQUIRE THIS EXPERTISE
ARE PRAISED IN BOTH THE QUR'AN AND HADITH - THOSE WHO WITHOUT THE REQUISITE
KNOWLEDGE PRONOUNCE ON MATTERS THAT AFFECT SOCIETY, STATE, AND RELIGION 
ARE CAUTIONED.

THE ONLY REASON I SAID ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE RUSHDIE AFFAIR IN THIS
GROUP, IS BECAUSE THE WHOLE BASIS FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE FATWA (THAT IS,
APOSTASY), WAS WRONG. WHEN ONE DISCUSSES SOMETHING THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
BASE THEIR DISCUSSION ON FACT. SECONDLY, KHOMEINI WAS CONDEMNED AS A
HERETIC
BECAUSE HE SUPPOSEDLY CLAIMED TO BE INFALLIBLE - ANOTHER INSTANCE OF
CREATING A STRAW MAN AND THEN BEATING HIM.

> PERHAPS WE SHOULD TAKE OUR DISCUSSION TO SOC.RELIGION.ISLAM.  PLEASE
> EMAIL ME, RASHID, IF YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS.

I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD MOVE THE DISCUSSION TO ANOTHER NEWSGROUP.
UNFORTUNATELY,
I DO NOT HAVE ANY ACCESS TO EMAIL, SO PRIVATE DISCUSSION OR A MODERATED
GROUP
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION (I CANNOT POST TO A MODERATED GROUP LIKE
SOC.RELIGION.ISLAM. HOW ABOUT SOC.CULTURE.ARABIC OR TALK.RELIGION.MISC?
