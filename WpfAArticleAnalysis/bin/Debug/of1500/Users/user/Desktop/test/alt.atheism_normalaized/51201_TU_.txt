WAIT A MINUTE.  I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT ALLAH (I PRESUME ALLAH == GOD) WAS UNKNOWABLE,
AND YET HERE YOU ARE CLAIMING TO KNOW A VERY CONCRETE FACT ABOUT HIM.

YOU SAY THAT GOD DOES NOT HAVE A "FACE".  DOESN'T THE BIBLE SAY THAT GOD HAS HINDPARTS?

HOW DO YOU SUGGEST I DECIDE WHICH (IF ANY) OF YOU IS RIGHT?  OR ARE YOU BOTH RIGHT?
GOD HAS HINDPARTS BUT NO FACE?  OR DOES YOUR USE OF QUOTATION MARKS:

	GOD DOES NOT HAVE A "FACE".

ALLOW YOU TO INTERPRET THIS TO MEAN WHATEVER YOU LIKE?
