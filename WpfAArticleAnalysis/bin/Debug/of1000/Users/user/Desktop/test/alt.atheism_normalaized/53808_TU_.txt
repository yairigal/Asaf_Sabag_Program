I'M SURE YOU ARE NOT.   AFTER THE "SAN FRANCISCO" EARTHQUAKE 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A FLURRY OF TRAFFIC ON 
TALK.RELIGION.MISC ABOUT HOW THIS WAS THE RESULT OF THE 
NOTORIOUS HOMO- THIS THAT AND T'OTHER IN THE CITY.

THE FACT THAT THE EARTHQUAKE WAS ACTUALLY DOWN THE ROAD IN
SANTA CRUZ/WATSONVILLE DIDN'T SEEM TO PHASE THEM ANY.
