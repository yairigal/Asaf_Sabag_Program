CRAIG-

I THOUGHT IT WAS DERIVED FROM A GREEK ACRONYM.  MY GREEK ISN'T UP TO MUCH, BUT
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

	JESUS CHRIST, GOD => IESUS CHRISTOS, THEOS => ICHTHOS

WHICH IS THE GREEK FOR "FISH" (AS IN, EG "ICHTHYSAURUS").

APOLOGIES FOR MY DREADFUL GREEK!  PERHAPS SOMEONE WILL CORRECT IT.

BY THE WAY, WHAT DOES YOUR SIG MEAN?
