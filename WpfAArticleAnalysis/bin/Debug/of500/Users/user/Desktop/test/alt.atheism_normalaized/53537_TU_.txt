KEVIN MAKES A GOOD POINT HERE, AND WHEN THAT THEISTS MISS ALL-TOO-OFTEN.  THAT
IS, THE BELIEF IN A DIETY IS NOT NECESSARILY COUPLED WITH AGREEMENT/LOVE OF
THAT DIETY, SO REALLY THEY HAVE YET ANOTHER BIT OF CONVINCING TO DO JUST BEYOND
BELIEF.
I GUESS THE STANDARD ARGUMET GOES SOMETHING LIKE: WELL, ONCE YOU BELIEVE IN
GOD, YOU KNOW GOD IS LOVE, AND YOU WILL CHOOSE TO LOVE HIM-- IF IT WASNT SO
WIDELY ACCEPTED AND ASSERTED IT'D BE LAUGHABLE...

BEST REGARDS,
