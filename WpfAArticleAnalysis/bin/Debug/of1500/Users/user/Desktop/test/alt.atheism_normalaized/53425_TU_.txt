DRESS CASUAL. ONLY IN HEAVEN IS THERE A DRESS CODE (BLACK TIE AND
SELF-IMPORTANT EXPRESSION)

DON'T FORGET TO SING:
            THEY SAY THERE'S A HEAVEN FOR THOSE WHO WILL WAIT
                SOME SAY IT'S BETTER, BUT I SAY IT AIN'T
        I'D RATHER LAUGH WITH THE SINNERS THAN CRY WITH THE SAINTS
                     THE SINNERS ARE MUCH MORE FUN
                         ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG!
