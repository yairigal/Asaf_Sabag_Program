Right Why should I assert anything about beings that I dont believe in 
When I have no good idea of what this being is like only some  
contradictory statements being made by various religions I cannot  
firmly assert anything specific  
 
A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist 
However we will first need a definition of god and the theistic 
religions do not agree very well on this Did you see my earlier 
posting on the existence of god Theists cannot even agree whether 
any god exists or metaexists or is herself the existence  
Omnipotence omnibenevolence and omniscience are other concepts 
theists do not all agree upon Thus it is hard to assert anything 
about a such fluxional beings Deus absconditus remains hidden 
from those who believe and from those who dont

I have to disagree here  first philosophical maxims are not necessarily 
something to build upon What can I build upon Occams Razor for  
instance Weak atheism is not a philosophy a philosophical system 
There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from 
ranging from reductionism my choice to objectivism Actually 
philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of gods 
 
Second your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles 
heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me and is actually a version 
of the oftheard theistic claim that but even atheists have to place their 
faith on something even if it is not god This has been discussed in 
the FAQ but from a different viewpoint and I do not repeat it 
 
I think one does not have to take anything on blind faith 
True one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer 
to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all however It is 
probably the simplest assumption one can make after solipsism 
of course
