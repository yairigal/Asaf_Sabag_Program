The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and  
exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  The 
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  
in any other war of comparable size this century  This was due mostly 
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques 
which were technically possible only recently 
 
The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is 
ludicrous  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died 
and they were the ones being targeted  Or do you think that the US 
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians 
Either the smart bombs didnt hit their targets and we know they did 
or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to 
destroying Iraqs military potential  The military mission planners are 
not fools they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war 
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you 
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their 
tyrantdictator
