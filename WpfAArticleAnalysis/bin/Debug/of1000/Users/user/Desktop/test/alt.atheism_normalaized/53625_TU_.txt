I CAN (AND DO) TAKE RELIGIOUS WRITINGS AS A METAPHOR FOR LIFE.
I DO THIS WITH ALL SORTS OF FICTION, FROM BEOWOLF TO DEEP SPACE NINE.
THE IDEA IS TO NOT LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONE BOOK, SCREEN OUT THE GOOD 
STUFF FROM WHAT YOU READ, AND TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS ALL JUST A STORY.  
YOU SOUND BUDDIST TO ME :^)
