No gravity is an inherent system  You dont need any excess information 
other than observations to determine anything  It is possible to objectively 
determine someones guilt or innocence within an noninherent system 
I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that 
everything we do has an evolutionary basis but this does not mean that 
it cannot be objective in theory

Perhaps it can be objective but not inherent  Anyway as I noted before 
the practices related to mating rituals etc among the animals are likely 
the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions 
of the natural law  Therefore some revisions are in order since the 
class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems

It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system 
because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would 
necessitate some sort of grand design

I think I have  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired 
behaviors etc
