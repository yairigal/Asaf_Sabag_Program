OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PULL A RUSHDIE THEN DECLARING ONE'S
LEAVING THE RELIGION IS LITTLE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT COMPARED TO ONE'S
OTHER PLANS.


IN RUSHDIE'S CASE, THE ONE UNDER DISCUSSION, ONE CAN. IT IS TRAGIC THAT
IN _SOME_ "ISLAMIC" COUNTRIES THIS IS SO. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, ISLAMIC
COUNTRIES (WHOSE CONSTITUTIONS CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ISLAMIC LAW IS
TO BE INCORPORATED), E.G. KUWAIT, WHERE ONE CAN FREELY MAKE SUCH
STATEMENTS WITHOUT FEAR.

THIS STORY HAS BECOME TIRESOME. THE CONDITIONS ARE CLEAR. IF YOU CARE TO
MAKE YOUR POINT CLEAR THEN MAKE A CHRONOLOGY AND SHOW THAT HE HAD MADE
PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT LEAVING ISLAM PRIOR TO HIS WRITING OF _TSV_. IF
HE DID MAKE SUCH STATEMENTS THEN HE SHOULD HAVE MADE _THAT_ CLEAR RATHER
THAN TRYING TO REJOIN ISLAM OR GO ON TALKING ABOUT HIS PERSONAL
FEELINGS.
