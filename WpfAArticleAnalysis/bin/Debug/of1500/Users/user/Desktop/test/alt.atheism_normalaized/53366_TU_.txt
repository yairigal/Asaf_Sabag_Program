SORRY FOR USING A FOLLOW-UP TO RESPOND, BUT MY SERVER DROPPED ABOUT A WEEKS WORTH OF NEWS
WHEN IT COULDN'T KEEP UP.

WHEN THE YOU ARE ASKED TO SWEAR "SO HELP YOU GOD" AND YOU HAVE TO SAY IT, ASK WHICH ONE; JESUS,
ALLAH, VISHNU, ZUES, ODIN.  GET THEM TO BE SPECIFIC.   DON'T BE OBNOXIOUS, JUST HUMBLY ASK, THEN 
QUITELY SIT BACK AND WATCH THE FUN.
