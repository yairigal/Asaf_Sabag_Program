ABSTRACT, IS THAT IT CREATES INFORMATION FROM NO INFORMATION.  THIS IS
CONSIDERED INVALID IN INFORMATION THEORY.  STATEMENT 1 INDICATES ONE HAS NO
INFORMATION ABOUT GOD -- BUT STATEMENT 2 INDICATES THAT BENEFICIAL INFORMATION
CAN BE GAINED FROM THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT GOD.  THIS VIOLATES
INFORMATION ENTROPY -- INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM NO INFORMATION, AT
NO "COST".

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IS TO CLAIM THAT 1 AND 2 ARE BOTH ASSUMPTIONS.  THE
PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT 2 IS THEN BASICALLY AN ASSUMPTION WHICH STATES THE
CHRISTIAN POSITION, AND ONLY A CHRISTIAN WILL AGREE WITH THAT ASSUMPTION. THE
ARGUMENT THUS COLLAPSES TO "IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, IT IS IN YOUR INTERESTS
TO BELIEVE IN GOD" -- A RATHER VACUOUS TAUTOLOGY, AND NOT THE WAY PASCAL
INTENDED THE ARGUMENT TO BE VIEWED.

THE BIGGEST REASON WHY PASCAL'S WAGER IS A FAILURE IS THAT IF GOD IS
OMNISCIENT HE WILL CERTAINLY KNOW WHO REALLY BELIEVES AND WHO BELIEVES AS
A WAGER.  HE WILL SPURN THE LATTER... ASSUMING HE ACTUALLY CARES AT ALL
WHETHER PEOPLE BELIEVE IN HIM.

SUBJECT: WHAT IS OCCAM'S RAZOR?

TYPICAL POSTING:

PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR.  WHAT IS IT?

RESPONSE:

WILLIAM OF OCCAM FORMULATED A PRINCIPLE WHICH HAS BECOME KNOWN AS OCCAM'S 
RAZOR.  IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, IT SAID "DO NOT MULTIPLY ENTITIES 
UNNECESSARILY."  THAT IS, IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOMETHING WITHOUT SUPPOSING
THE EXISTENCE OF SOME ENTITY, THEN DO SO.

NOWADAYS WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO OCCAM'S RAZOR, THEY GENERALLY EXPRESS IT 
MORE GENERALLY, FOR EXAMPLE AS "TAKE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION".

THE RELEVANCE TO ATHEISM IS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS 
FOR WHAT WE SEE AROUND US:

1. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE, WHICH
CAME INTO BEING AS A RESULT OF NATURAL PROCESSES.

2. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE, AND 
THERE IS ALSO A GOD WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE.  CLEARLY THIS GOD MUST BE 
OF NON-ZERO COMPLEXITY.

GIVEN THAT BOTH EXPLANATIONS FIT THE FACTS, OCCAM'S RAZOR MIGHT SUGGEST 
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THE SIMPLER OF THE TWO -- SOLUTION NUMBER ONE.
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME ARGUE THAT THERE IS A THIRD EVEN MORE SIMPLE SOLUTION:

3. THERE ISN'T AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE OUT THERE.  
WE JUST IMAGINE THAT THERE IS.

THIS THIRD OPTION LEADS US LOGICALLY TOWARDS SOLIPSISM, WHICH MANY PEOPLE 
FIND UNACCEPTABLE.

TYPICAL POSTING:

I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE VIRTUES AND BENEFITS OF MY RELIGION.

RESPONSE:

PREACHING IS NOT APPRECIATED.

FEEL FREE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR RELIGION, BUT PLEASE DO NOT WRITE POSTINGS THAT
ARE ON A "CONVERSION" THEME.  SUCH POSTINGS DO NOT BELONG ON ALT.ATHEISM AND
WILL BE REJECTED FROM ALT.ATHEISM.MODERATED (TRY THE NEWSGROUP
TALK.RELIGION.MISC).

YOU WOULD DOUBTLESS NOT WELCOME POSTINGS FROM ATHEISTS TO YOUR FAVOURITE
NEWSGROUP IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONVERT YOU; PLEASE DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD
HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU!

OFTEN THEISTS MAKE THEIR BASIC CLAIMS ABOUT GOD IN THE FORM OF LENGTHY
ANALOGIES OR PARABLES.  BE AWARE THAT ATHEISTS HAVE HEARD OF GOD AND KNOW THE
BASIC CLAIMS ABOUT HIM; IF THE SOLE PURPOSE OF YOUR PARABLE IS TO TELL
ATHEISTS THAT GOD EXISTS AND BRINGS SALVATION, YOU
