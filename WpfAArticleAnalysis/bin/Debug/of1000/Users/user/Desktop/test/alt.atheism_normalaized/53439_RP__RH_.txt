 The social pressure is indeed a very important factor for the majority 
 of passive Christians in our world today In the case of early Christianity 
 the promise of a heavenly afterlife independent of your social status 
 was also a very promising gift reason slaves and nonRomans accepted 
 the religion very rapidly 
 
If this is a hypothetical proposition you should say so if its 
fact you should cite your sources If all this is the amateur 
sociologist subbranch of aa however it would suffice to alert the 
unwary that you are just screwing around
