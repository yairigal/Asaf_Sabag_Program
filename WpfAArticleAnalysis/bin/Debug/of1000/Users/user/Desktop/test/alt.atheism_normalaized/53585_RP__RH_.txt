From whose point of view would you like to know what relativism concludes  
One of the people involved in the argument or some third person observing 
the arguers 
 
Ive just come from responding another of your posts where some pennies 
have dropped for me  But it would clarify further if you would answer 
from the point of view of any disinterested observers  perhaps an 
observer as likely to be in position A as in position B where A and B 
disagree in the future and have his or her conclusion now binding on 
them at that time
