BENEDIKT ROSENAU WRITES, WITH GREAT AUTHORITY:

>     IF IT IS CONTRADICTORY IT CANNOT EXIST.

"CONTRADICTORY" IS A PROPERTY OF LANGUAGE.  IF I CORRECT THIS TO


      THINGS DEFINED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

I WILL OBJECT TO DEFINITIONS AS REALITY.  IF YOU THEN AMEND IT TO

      THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

THEN WE'VE COME TO SOMETHING WHICH IS PLAINLY FALSE.  FAILURES IN
DESCRIPTION ARE MERELY FAILURES IN DESCRIPTION.

(I'M NOT AN OBJECTIVIST, REMEMBER.)
