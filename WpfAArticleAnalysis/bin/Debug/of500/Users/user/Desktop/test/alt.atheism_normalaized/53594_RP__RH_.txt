Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism 
The point is that theism is *a* factor

Thats a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the 
field of theism the leaders believe what they say

Thats a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is 
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism 
  
Gullibility by the way is one of them 
  
  
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw 
men Interesting that you have nothing better to offer
