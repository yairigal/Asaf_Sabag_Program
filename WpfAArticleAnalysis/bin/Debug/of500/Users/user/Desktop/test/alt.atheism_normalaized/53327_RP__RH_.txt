Another one rescued from the bit bucket 
 
Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on aa and 
elsewhere on the net  Generally the discussion comes down to the 
contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against 
Islam as to merit if not death than at least banning and probably 
some sort of punishment and on the other that Rushdie particularly 
as a nonmuslim in a Western country had every right to write and 
publish whatever he chose regardless of whether some muslims find it 
offensive without fear of persecution or death   
 
I am naturally inclined to the latter position but find myself in an 
interesting position because I think this is a fine book only 
incidentally concerned with Islam and moreover Im damned if I can 
find anything malevolently offensive in it 
 
Over the years when I have made this point various primarily muslim 
posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book 
and had called it such things as filth and lies I would rank 
Rushdies book with Hitlers Mein Kempf or worse and so on 
Unfortunately these comments are usually generalities and attempts 
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so 
offensive have met either with stony silence more generalizations or 
inaccurate or outofcontext references to the book which lead me to 
believe that few of them have actually read it  Corrections and 
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored 
 
Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line 
of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have 
read this book  What are your thoughts on it
