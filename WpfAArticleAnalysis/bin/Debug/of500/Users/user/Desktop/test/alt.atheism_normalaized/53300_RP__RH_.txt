 I think you misunderstand  Suppose you have a couple of gas atoms in a 
 container  If you ionise one of them you generally assume that the other is 
 not affected  This is only true to a certain degree of accuracy luckily 
 there are all sorts of effects we can ignore when doing chemistry  Like 
 gravitational forces for example because theyre very weak 
 
Agreed But your original posting seemed to me to be just another  
Heisenbergian misunderstanding of what chemists do  Heisenberg 
said biologists are treating atoms just like they were solid balls 
This is what some chemists used to do too but this is not how 
chemistry is taught today 
  
 And I agree  I think you merely misunderstood the point I was trying to 
 make which is that we simplify the real situation to something we can deal 
 with  For instance we talk about electron pairs and draw diagrams of 
 molecules with little markings to show these pairs of electrons  This is 
 actually nonsense but its a perfectly good model for predicting all kinds 
 of chemical reactions 
 
Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think 
this way It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of 
electron pairs and valences but this is not what chemists are taught  
and this is not how they should think  
 
I suggest you take a look at PW Atkinss classic text Physical Chemistry 
4th ed Oxford University Press 1990 to see how chemistry is taught today 
 
However I still agree with your point  concepts must be allowed to 
operate at a pragmatic level In chemistry this usually means we must use 
different models for different situations It is unfair to say that 
chemists simply ignore effects they cant deal with  on the contrary 
they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models  
  
 I remember thinking the first time I saw the shapes of the electron 
 orbitals They have *got* to be kidding 
 
If someone insists that electron is confined inside these shapes 
it would indeed constitute a joke The shapes are still important  
even though they are only visual representations of the radial and 
angular functions The surfaces are arbitrary and not really important   
what is more important in chemistry are the signs of the wavefunctions 
 
Is there something wrong with the representations
