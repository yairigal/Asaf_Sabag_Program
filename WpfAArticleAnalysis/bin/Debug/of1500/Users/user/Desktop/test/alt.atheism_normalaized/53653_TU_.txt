WHAT A COINCIDENCE!  THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I'VE EXPERIENCED IT TOO.
SO FAR.
TROUBLE IS, I'VE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF IT IS JUST COINCIDENCE.
THAT IS, IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THAT WAY IN ALL MEASUREMENTS TO DATE.
BUT I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR AS SAYING THAT IT WILL ALWAYS BE SO - OR THAT IT NEED

>THE REFERENCE FRAME MAKES THE SPEED RELATIVE.  BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING
>HERE IS THAT EVERY PERSON ON THE TRAIN WILL SEE A STATIONARY BULLET.
>EVERY PERSON OFF, A BULLET MOVING 60MPH.  

MORE COINCIDENCE!  WOW.
STILL - I WISH I COULD BE *SURE* THAT IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIKE THAT.
