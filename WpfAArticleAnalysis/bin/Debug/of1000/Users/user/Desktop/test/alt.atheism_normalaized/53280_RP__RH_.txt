  First I dont expect them to love me if they dont even know I 
  exist  Secondly I wouldnt expect them to love me simply because 
  they were my creator  I would expect to have to earn that love

  Are you daft  How do I love something I dont believe exists 
  Come back when youve learned to love your third testicle

  At which point you have stepped over the line and become a 
  complete asshole  Even though its your first offense I wont 
  let it slip becuase Ive heard it too goddamned many times 
 
  You love Jesus because deep in your heart youre a cannibalistic 
  necrophiliac  Because I say so and Im much more qualified to 
  assess your motivations than you are 
 
  Fortunately there are some things I get to accept on evidence 
  rather than faith  One of them being that until christians like 
  yourself quit being so fucking arrogant there will never be 
  peace  Youve all made sure of that
