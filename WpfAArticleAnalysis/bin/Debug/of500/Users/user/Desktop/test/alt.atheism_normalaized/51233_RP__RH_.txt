No you dont understand  I said that I dont think people can discuss 
the subjective merits of religion objectively  This should be obvious 
People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion 
but this almost certainly isnt true

But guns and axes are tools both of which have been used for murder 
Should both be taken away  That is to say I dont think motto misuse 
warrants its removal  At least not in this case
