So 
 
Of course hes a paleontologist  Hes also an evolutionist  In fact 
Im damn glad hes made it apparent that evolutionary biology has the 
ability to adapt to new lines of evidence and to develop new theories 
Otherwise it wouldnt be science it would be something like 
creationism 
 
So when should we expect your next outofcontext quote John E King 
Do creationists like yourself ever use anything other than appeal to 
authority to support arguments  Like science maybe  I guess not 
And they wonder why they cant teach creationism in science 
classrooms
