Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism 
The point is that theism is *a* factor 
 
Thats your claim now back it up  I consider your argument as useful 
as the following  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  Therefore 
belief is *a* factor in fanaticism  True and utterly useless  Note this 
is *any* belief not belief in Gods

Thats a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the 
field of theism the leaders believe what they say 
 
If you believe that youre incredibly naive

Thats a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is 
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism 
 
No some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common 
with *some* fanaticism    Your last statement simply isnt implied by 
what you say before because youre trying to sneak in innate features 
of all theism  The word youre groping for is some 
 
Gullibility by the way is one of them 
 
No shit Sherlock  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism 
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed 
to the case you are trying to make 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw 
men Interesting that you have nothing better to offer 
 
I said it reads like a warm up to that  Thats because its an irrational 
and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice ThemUs  
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either 
side of church walls

Thats bogus Self reference is not circular And since the evaluation of 
usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed 
 
OK its oval  Its still begging the question however  And though 
that certainly is allowed its not rational  And you claiming to be 
rational and all 
 
At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we 
didnt hear a refutation before so were back   Deal with it  
you cant use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  Someone 
who thinks reason is crap wont buy it you see 
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics 
and mathematics are therfore circular 
 
Anybody else think Godel was silly

Ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions 
of god here 
  
An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here 
is a an often refuted fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the 
axiom of choice And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems 
out of which they are usually derived I exist is derived if you want 
it that way 
 
Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms 
  
what is it you are trying to say 
 
That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable  
for no particular reason at all  Example I am not dreaming

Using the traditonal definition of gods Personal supernatural entities 
with objective effects on this world Usually connected to morals andor 
the way the world works 
 
IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  That does 
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of 
intelligence  Some atheists are also scientists for example

Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice That does not make 
B true it is at best a work hypothesis However the content of B is that 
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluating 
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B already believed 
says it is wronG a waste  of time not possible Depending on the further 
contents of B AmalekitesIdolatersProtestants are to be killed this can 
have interesting effects 
 
Peculiar definition of interesting but sure  Now show that a belief 
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   Why arent my  
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   Maybe they  
dont believe in it  Maybe its the conjunction of B asserts B and 
jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is 
entirely irrelevant  It certainly seems so to me but then I have no 
axe to grind here
