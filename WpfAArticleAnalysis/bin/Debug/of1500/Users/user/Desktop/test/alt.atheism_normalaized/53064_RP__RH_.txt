No  It wouldnt be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this 
was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell  The point was  
that recently many messages were posted from that address  Each of these 
messages was posted to a different newsgroup with the apparent intent of 
provoking the readers of that particular group  This along with the fact 
that these posts were written in allcaps makes these posts suspect 
Whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly  If it is the 
intended user they should consider appropriate action  If it is someone 
else which seems a possibility then this is also reason to report it 
	We get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread 
It is only because I have seen posts on other groups by this user that I 
am considering action
