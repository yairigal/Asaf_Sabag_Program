Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting 
The problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real 
believer and who may be faking it  This is something known only by 
the person himherself and God  Your assumption that anyone who 
claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true 
 
In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and 
false Muslim We are back to square one Khomeini and Hussein are  
still innocent and cant be defined as evil or good Islamic  
worshippers
