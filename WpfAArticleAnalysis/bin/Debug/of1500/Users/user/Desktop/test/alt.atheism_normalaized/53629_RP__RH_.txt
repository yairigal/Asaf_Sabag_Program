Riddle me this  If a gods exist why on earth should we grovel  Why on earth 
should we give a damm at all  What evidence do you have that if such a 
creatures exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer 
hatred for what itthey have done in the past whichever gods you care to 
pick  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct 
 
Religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate 
from the physical world  Any belief system can leave you in such a state 
and so can drugs  Gods are not a requirement  Only if you remove such 
useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon 
It is that or keep on exterminating those who dont believe or converting 
them
