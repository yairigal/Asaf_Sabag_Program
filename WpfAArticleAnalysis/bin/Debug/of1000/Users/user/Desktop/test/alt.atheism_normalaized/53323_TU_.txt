TRUE.  AT FIRST, THE NEWS MEDIA SEEMED ENTRANCED BY ALL THE NEW GIZMOS
THE MILITARY WAS USING, NOT TO MENTION THE TAPED VIDEO TRANSMISSIONS FROM
THE MISSILES AS THEY ZEROED IN ON THEIR TARGETS.  BUT LATER, AND ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE BUNKER FULL OF CIVILIANS WAS HIT, THEY CHANGED THEIR TONE.  IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR THE REALITY OF WAR,
THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE REALLY DO DIE AND ARE MAIMED IN WARFARE.  IT'S LIKE
THEY WERE ONLY PRO-GULF-WAR AS LONG AS IT WAS "NICE AND CLEAN" (SMART
MISSILES DROPPING IN ON MILITARY HQS), BUT NOT WHEN PICTURES OF DEAD,
DYING, AND MAIMED CIVILIANS STARTED CROPPING UP.  WHAT NAIVE HYPOCRITES!

I SHOULD HAVE SAID HERE "MILITARILY JUSTIFIED".  IT SEEMS FROM YOUR
COMMENTS BELOW THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD THIS AS MEANING "MORALLY JUSTIFIED".
I APOLOGIZE.

I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED ABOUT THIS.  I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE FIRST BOMB
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED ON JAPAN'S ISLAND FORTRESS OF TRUK.  A GOOD,
INPENATRABLE MILITARY TARGET.  THE SECOND BOMB COULD'VE BEEN HELD BACK
FOR USE ON AN INDUSTRIAL CENTER IF NEED BE.  BUT I DIGRESS.

YES, I HAVE HEARD THAT WE FOUND EVIDENCE (AFTER THE WAR, BTW) THAT JAPAN
WAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SURRENDER AFTER THE FIRST BOMB.  UNFORTUNATELY,
THE MILITARY JUNTA WON OUT OVER THE MODERATES AND REJECTED THE US'S
ULIMATUM.  THEREFORE THE SECOND BOMB WAS DROPPED.  MOST UNFORTUNATE, IMO.

I DON'T REGRET THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES MILITARY DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
WHICH AFFECT THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.  BUT I DO REGRET THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE THOSE DECISIONS NECESSARY, AND I REGRET THE
SUFFERING CAUSED BY THOSE DECISIONS.

ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE FACT THAT BOTH SITUATIONS EXISTED THAT PROMPTED US
AND ALLIED ACTION.  IF SOME BACK-WATER COUNTRY TOOK OVER SOME OTHER
BACK-WATER COUNTRY, WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T INTERVENE.  NOT THAT WE DON'T
CARE, BUT WE CAN'T BE THE WORLD'S POLICMAN.  OR IF A COUP HAD OCCURED
IN KUWAIT (INSTEAD OF AN INVASION), THEN WE STILL WOULDN'T HAVE ACTED
BECAUSE THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE IMMINENT DANGER PERCEIVED TO
SAUDI ARABIA.  BUT THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO, AN UNPROVOKED INVASION
BY A GENOCIDAL TYRANT AND THE POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE WEST'S OIL 
INTERESTS, CAUSED US TO TAKE ACTION.

I'M NOT SETTING UP A STRAWMAN AT ALL.  IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE AGAINST THE
WAR, THEN THE ONLY LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE WAS TO ALLOW HUSSEIN TO KEEP
KUWAIT.  DIPLOMATIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING SANCTIONS, WERE INEFFECTIVE.

WELL, IN A SENSE, YES.  THEY PROBABLY HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT END HITLER
