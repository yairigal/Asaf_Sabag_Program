YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIED ONE OF THE SOC.CULTURE GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
OR SOUTH ASIA AREA (THEY ARE A LITTLE MORE OPEN THAN THE ISLAM CHANNEL).  
I THINK SOMEONE DEFINED ATHEISTS AS POLYTHEISTS CUZ THEY SAY WE THINK THE 
WORLD CREATED ITSELF (OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT) SO EACH PARTICLE IS A GOD 
WHICH CREATED THE OTHER GODS.  THE SOC.CULTURE.AFRICAN IS ALSO NICE FOR 
SOME CONTRASTING VIEWPOINTS ON THE BENEVOLENCE OF RELIGION.  ESPECIALLY 
WHEN SUDAN IS MENTIONED.
