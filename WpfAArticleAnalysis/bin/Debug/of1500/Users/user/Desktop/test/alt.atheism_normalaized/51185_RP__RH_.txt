I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa 
against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally 
insulting  
 
I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long 
posting and to say  
 
	I dont know if you are doing so but it  
	seems you are implying 
 
is at the very best quite disingenuous and perhaps even 
dishonest    If anyone care to dig back and read the full 
posting they will see nothing of the kind 
 
I trust you dont deny that Islamic teaching has something 
to do with the fatwa against Rushdie
