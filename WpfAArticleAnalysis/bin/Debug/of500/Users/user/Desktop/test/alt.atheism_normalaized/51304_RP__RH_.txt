New in this version  challenge 5 plus an addendum summarizing 
Charleys responses todate 
 
 
*** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage 
*** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently  
*** specious claims  Ill continue to repost periodically until 
*** he answers them publicly indicates that he wont answer them 
*** stops posting to altatheism the altatheism community tells 
*** me to stop or I get totally bored  I apologize for the  
*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but Im at a loss 
*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  
*** seeming intellectual dishonesty 
*** 
*** This is repost 3 
 
 
Charley 
 
I cant help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers 
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your 
previous posts  I submit that you dont answer them because you 
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and I once 
again challenge you to prove me wrong  To make the task as easy for 
you as possible Ill present concise restatements of some of the 
questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may 
address them one at a time for all to see 
 
Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period I 
will repost this article with suitable additions and deletions at 
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic  I will repeat 
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or 
you cease to post to this newsgroup 
 
I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these 
questions previously and your answer missed my notice  If you can be 
kind enough to repost or email such articles I will be only too 
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it 
from this list 
 
Now to the questions 
 
1 After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological 
patterns that you proposed then semiretracting that claim by stating 
that you werent referring to *all* atheists I asked you to name some 
atheists who you feel dont fit your patterns to show that you indeed 
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of  You failed 
to do so  Please do so now 
 
Question Can you name any aa posters who do not fit into your 
stereotype 
 
Here is the context for the question
