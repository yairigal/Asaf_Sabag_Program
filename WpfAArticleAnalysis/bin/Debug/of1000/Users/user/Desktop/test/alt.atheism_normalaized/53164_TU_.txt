I HAVE MADE THIS CLEAR ELSEWHERE BUT WILL DO SO AGAIN. KHOMEINI PUT A 
PRICE ON THE HEAD OF SOMEONE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, THIS MAKES HIM A JERK
AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL OUTLAW. KHOMEINI ADVOCATES THE VIEW THAT
THERE WAS A SERIES OF TWELVE ISLAMIC LEADERS (THE TWELVE IMAMS) WHO
ARE FREE OF ERROR OR SIN. THIS MAKES HIM A HERETIC. IN THE QUR'AN 
MUHAMMAD IS CHASTISED FOR ERROR DIRECTLY BY GOD; THE QUR'AN SAYS THAT
MUHAMMAD IS THE GREATEST EXAMPLE OF PROPER ISLAMIC BEHAVIOR; THUS
NO MUSLIM IS FREE FROM ERROR. 


>AS USUAL THERE SEEMS TO BE ALMOST AS MANY ISLAMIC VIEWPOINTS AS THERE
>ARE MUSLIMS.  

PERHAPS IT SEEMS SO TO YOU, BUT THIS IS HARDLY THE CASE. THERE IS
WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT ABOUT MATTERS OF ISLAM. THERE CERTAINLY ARE
MANY VIEWPOINTS ON ISSUES WHICH ARE NOT PARTICULARLY ISLAMIC IN
AND OF THEMSELVES, BUT THIS IS SO FOR ANY LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE
UNDER THE SAME NAME. 

>IT ALL COMES BACK TO THE KORAN BEING SO IMPRECISE IN ITS WORDING.

THE QUR'AN IS NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRECISE IN WORDING, THOUGH IT IS TRUE
THAT SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE INTERPRETATIONS OF
MANY WORDS. HOWEVER, AS AN ENTIRE TEXT THE QUR'AN MAKES ITS MEANINGS
PRECISE ENOUGH FOR INTELLIGENT PEOPLE FREE FROM POWER LUST TO COME
TO AGREEMENT ABOUT THEM.
