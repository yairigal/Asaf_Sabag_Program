I tend to agree  I came here when it first started and watched it grow 
from the roots on talkreligionmisc  It seemed to take a while for enough 
atheists to come forward to get past the Lets trash Xians and such 
Now theres a stable core and frankly theres a feeling that this is 
our group 
 
If we go mainstream were going to be in a lot more places  And every 
fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus and 
warn us that were all going to Hell 
 
Want to see what well get  Go real altfanbrotherjed and imagine that 
those imbecilic tirades will be here  All the time  Every other post 
 
Im being selfish  I find I really learn a lot here and the SN isnt too 
bad  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction but they are few enough 
that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them  But 
I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping 
level of the Conners of the world
