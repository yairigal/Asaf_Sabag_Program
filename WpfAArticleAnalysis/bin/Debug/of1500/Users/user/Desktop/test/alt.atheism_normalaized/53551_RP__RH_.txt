 BULLSHIT In the Gulf Massacre 7 of all ordnance used was smart The 
 rest  thats 93  was just regular dumb ol iron bombs and stuff Have 
 you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch 
 was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage Or that a 
 successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud 
 passed each other in the same area of the sky 
  
 And of the 7 that was the smart stuff 35 hit Again  try to follow me 
 here  that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed 
 
I used to have full figures on this including the tons of bombs dropped 
and the number of cluster bomblet munitions used I had heard the 90 of 
the laserguided weapons hit which is an unprecedented rate of success 
25 of the iron weapons hit again unprecedented The following is a rough 
estimate but this means of the 80000 tons of bombs dropped by US aircraft 
around 56000 tons *missed* Im not sure what proportion of this was 
dropped of Baghdad rather than troop concentrations in Iraq and Kuwait 
Much of the tonnage dropped was cluster munitions as were all the MRLS 
rounds and many of the artillery rounds Napalm and fuel air explosives 
were also used Remember how we were told that weapons of mass destruction 
such as FAE were very naughty indeed
