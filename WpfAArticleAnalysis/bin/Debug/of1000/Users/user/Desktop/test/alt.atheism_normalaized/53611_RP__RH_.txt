I was talking to the head of the archeology dept once in college and 
the topic of Mormon archeology came up  It seems that the Mormon church 
is or was big on giving grants to archeologists to prove that the 
native Americans are really the lost tribe of Israel and other such 
bunk  The archeologists would shake their head knowingly while listening 
to them take the grant and go off to do real archeology anyway
