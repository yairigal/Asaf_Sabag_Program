Not any more so than 
 
      holding people against their will is wrong 
      if you hold people against their will we will punish you 
      our punishment will be to hold you against your will 
 
Is there any punishment which isnt something which if done by a private 
person to another private person for no apparent reason would lead to 
punishment  Fines I suppose
