FRED RICE ANSWERED THIS ALREADY IN AN EARLY POSTING:
"THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU DO NOT _KNOW_ WHO IS A _REAL_
BELIEVER AND WHO MAY BE "FAKING IT".  THIS IS SOMETHING KNOWN ONLY BY
THE PERSON HIM/HERSELF (AND GOD).  YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT ANYONE WHO
_CLAIMS_ TO BE A "BELIEVER" _IS_ A "BELIEVER" IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE."

IN OTHER WORDS IT SEEMS THAT NOBODY COULD DEFINE WHO IS A TRUE AND
FALSE MUSLIM. WE ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE, KHOMEINI AND HUSSEIN ARE 
STILL INNOCENT AND CAN'T BE DEFINED AS EVIL OR GOOD ISLAMIC 
WORSHIPPERS.
