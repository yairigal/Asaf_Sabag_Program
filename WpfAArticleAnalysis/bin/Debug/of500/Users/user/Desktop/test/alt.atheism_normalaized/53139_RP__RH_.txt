Your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable 
posts The first I captured was by Ken Arromdee on 19 Feb 1990 on the 
subject Re atheist too That was article 473 here your question 
was article 53766 which is an average of about 48 articles a day for 
the last three years As others have noted the current posting rate is 
such that my kill file is depressing large Among the posting I 
saved in the early days were articles from the following notables 
 
>From lorensunlightllnlgov Loren Petrich 
>From jchristnazarethisraelrel Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
>From mrcTomobikiChoCACWashingtonEDU Mark Crispin 
>From perryapolloHPCOM Jim Perry 
>From lipparduavax0ccitarizonaedu James J Lippard
