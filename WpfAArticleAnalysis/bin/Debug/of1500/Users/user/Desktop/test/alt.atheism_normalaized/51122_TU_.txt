TAKE YOUR FOOT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, I WONDERED ABOUT THAT ALREADY WHEN I
WAS A CATHOLIC CHRISTIAN. THE FACT THAT THE CONTRADICTION IS UNRESOLVABLE
IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM AN ATHEIST.
 
BELIEVE ME, I BELIEVED SIMILAR SENTENCES FOR A LONG TIME. BUT THAT SHOWS
THE POWER OF RELIGION AND NOT ANYTHING ABOUT ITS CLAIMS.
 
 
>>>NOW GOD COULD HAVE PREVENTED LUCIFER'S FALL BY TAKING AWAY HIS ABILITY
>>>TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MORAL ALTERNATIVES (WORSHIP GOD OR WORSHIP HIMSELF),
>>>BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT GOD WAS IN ERROR TO HAVE MAKE LUCIFER OR ANY

IT FOLLOWS FROM A DEFINITION OF EVIL AS ORDINARILY USED. LETTING EVIL
HAPPEN OR ALLOWING EVIL TO TAKE PLACE, IN THIS PLACE EVEN CAUSING EVIL,
IS ANOTHER EVIL.
 
 
>> BUT COULD YOU GIVE A DEFINITION OF FREE WILL? ESPECIALLY IN THE
>> PRESENCE OF AN OMNISCIENT BEING?
>>
>"WILL" IS "SELF-DETERMINATION".  IN OTHER WORDS, GOD CREATED CONSCIOUS
>BEINGS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MORAL CHOICES INDEPENDENTLY
>OF GOD.  ALL "WILL", THEREFORE, IS "FREE WILL".
>
 
THE OMNISCIENT ATTRIBUTE OF GOD WILL KNOW WHAT THE CREATURES WILL DO EVEN
BEFORE THE OMNIPOTENT HAS CREATED THEM. THERE IS NO CHOICE LEFT. ALL IS KNOWN,
THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS FIXED.
 
NOT EVEN FOR THE OMNISCIENT ITSELF, TO EXTEND AN ARGUMENT BY JAMES TIMS.
 
 
>>>IF GOD IS OMNISCIENT, THEN
>>>CLEARLY, CREATING BEINGS WITH FREE MORAL CHOICE IS A GREATER GOOD THAN
>>>THE EMERGENCE OF UNGODLINESS (EVIL/SIN) SINCE HE CREATED THEM KNOWING
>>>THE OUTCOME IN ADVANCE.
>>
>> WHY IS IT THE GREATER GOOD TO ALLOW EVIL WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT
>> WILL HAPPEN? WHY NOT MAKE A UNIPOLAR SYSTEM WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF
>> DOING GOOD OR NOT DOING GOOD, BUT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY
>> DOING EVIL. IT IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE, BUT YOUR GOD HAS NOT DONE IT.
>
>I DO NOT KNOW THAT SUCH IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE.  IF GOD RESTRAINS A
>FREE BEING'S CHOICE TO CHOOSE TO DO EVIL AND SIMPLY DO "NOT GOOD",
>THEN CAN IT BE SAID THAT THE BEING TRULY HAS A FREE MORAL CHOICE?
>AND IF "GOOD" IS DEFINED AS LOVING AND OBEYING GOD, AND AVOIDING
>THOSE BEHAVIORS WHICH GOD PROHIBITS, THEN HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE
>WHO IS "NOT GOOD" IS NOT EVIL AS WELL?  LIKE I SAID, I AM NOT SURE
>THAT DOING "NOT GOOD" WITHOUT DOING EVIL IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE.
 
AND WHEN I AM NOT OMNIPOTENT, HOW CAN I HAVE FREE WILL? YOU HAVE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT CHOICES AND THE SCENARIO GIVES THEM. THEREFORE WE HAVE
WHAT YOU DEFINE AS FREE WILL.
 
IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING. I CAN DO GOOD TO OTHER BEINGS, BUT I CANNOT HARM THEM.
EASILY IMPLEMENTED BY MAKING EVERYONE APPRECIATE BEING THE OBJECT OF GOOD
DEEDS, BUT DON'T MAKE THEM LONG FOR THEM, SO THEY CAN NOT FEEL THE ABSENCE
OF GOOD AS EVIL.
 
BUT WHOSE CASE AM I ARGUING? IT IS CONCEIVABLE, SO THE OMNIPOTENT CAN DO IT.
OR IT WOULD NOT BE OMNIPOTENT. IF YOU WANT LOGICALLY CONSISTENT AS WELL, YOU
HAVE TO GIVE UP THE PET IDEA OF AN OMNIPOTENT FIRST.

THAT THE BIBLE DESCRIBES AN OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT GOD DESTROYS
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE BIBLE, NOTHING LESS.
 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN EVIDENCE FOR A GOD,
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE CAN'T BE ANY WITH THESE DEFINITIONS.
