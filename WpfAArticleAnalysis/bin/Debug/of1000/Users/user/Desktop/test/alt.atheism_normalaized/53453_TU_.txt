NOW I'LL RAISE THE ISSUE AGAIN IN CONNECTION WITH MR O'DWYER'S USE
OF THE WORD "PLAUSIBLE".

I CAN PLAUSE ALL KINDS OF CASES, FOR EXAMPLE: IN WHICH PEOPLE 
ACTUALLY OWN LAND, BUT DON'T KNOW THAT, AND SO ARE WILLING TO "SELL" 
IT IN PLAY FOR DERISORY SUMS, ONLY TO FIND THAT THEY SOLD IT FOR
REAL.   CASES IN WHICH THEIR MENTAL CAPACITY IS IMNPAIRED.   CASES
IN WHICH THEY ERR ABOUT THE TRUE VALUE OF WHAT THEY ARE SELLING.

PRETTY SOON YOU HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT "INFORMED OWNER"
"COMPETENT OWNER" "EDUCATED OWNER" AND SO ON, AND THE CONCEPT
GETS LESS AND LESS CLEAR AND EXCEPTIONS MORE AND MORE PLAUSIBLE.

BUT THE REAL PROBLEM REMAINS THAT OF LOOKING ONLY AT END-POINTS
IN A CONTEXT.    MAYBE MOST OF US WILL AGREE WITH YOU THAT A PEBBLE 
IS "SMALL" AND THAT THE MOON IS "BIG", BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURING SCALE.   ONLY THAT THESE TWO ARE 
FAIRLY COMMON OPINIONS *IN CONTEXT*.

AN ASTRONOMER MAY CLAIM THAT THE MOON IS ACTUALLY "TINY" AND
A MICRO-BIOLOGIST MAY REMARK THAT A PEBBLE IS "HUGE".   SIMILARLY,
IF AN ARMED SERBIAN OFFERS A HELPLESS BOSNIAN A DOLLAR AND HIS 
LIFE FOR HIS LAND, RATHER THAN KILLING HIM AND TAKING IT FOR FREE, 
THE BOSNIAN MAY CONSIDER THAT HE IS GETTING QUITE A GOOD DEAL.

JON.
