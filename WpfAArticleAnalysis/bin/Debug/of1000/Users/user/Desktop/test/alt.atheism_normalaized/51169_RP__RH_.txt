   Just what do gay people do that straight people dont 
 
Absolutely nothing 
 
Im a VERY straightas an arrow 17year old male that is involved in the BSA 
 
I dont care what gay people do among each other as long as they dont make 
passes at me or anything  At my summer camp where I work my boss is gay 
Not in a pansy way of gay I know a few but just one of the guys 
He doesnt push anything on me and we give him the same respect back due 
to his position 
 
If anything the BSA has taught me I dont know tolerance or something 
Before I met this guy I thought all gays were faries  So the BSA HAS 
taught me to be an antibigot 
 
Basically It comes down to this What you do among yourself is your own 
business No one else has the right to tell you otherwise unless it 
violates someone elses civil rights
