Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without  
reading the FAQ  I was laughing for a good 5 minutes  Were there any  
parts of the FAQ that werent mentioned  I think there might have been one 
or two 
 
Please dont tell me this wasnt a joke  Im not ready to hear that yet
