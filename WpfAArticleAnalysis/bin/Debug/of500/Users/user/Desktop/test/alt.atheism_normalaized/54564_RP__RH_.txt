Isaac Asimov read creationist books  He read the Bible  He had ample 
opportunity to kneel before his Creator and Savior  He refused  In 
fact he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the 
American Humanist Association shortly before he died 
 
   excerpt from Ken Ham Asimov Meets His Creator Back to Genesis 
     No 42 June 1992 p c included in Acts  Facts vol 21 no 6 
     June 1992 from the Institute for Creation Research  This is one 
     of the most offensive articles theyve ever publishedbut at least 
     it argues *against* a deathbed conversion  Theres a part of the 
     article even worse than what Ive just quoted in which an excerpt 
     from a readers letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now 
     then he certainly has had a 180degree change in his former beliefs 
     about creation and the Creator  A postdeathbed conversion
