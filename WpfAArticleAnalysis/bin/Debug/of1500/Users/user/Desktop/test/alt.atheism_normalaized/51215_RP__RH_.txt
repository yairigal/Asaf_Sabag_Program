I would rather be at a higher risk of being killed than actually killed by 
                                                     
mistake  Though I do agree with the concept that the type D and E murderers 
are a massive waste of space and resources I dont agree with the concept 
 
	killing is wrong 
	if you kill we will punish you 
	our punishment will be to kill you 
 
Seems to be lacking in consistency 
 
 
I know is nothing more than I believe with pretentions
