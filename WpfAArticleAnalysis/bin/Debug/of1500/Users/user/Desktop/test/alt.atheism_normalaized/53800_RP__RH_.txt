Of course  Hitchings believes in evolution  The purpose of the quote I 
sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own 
theory  For example on page 107 he states one may question an  
evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it  If 
Darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology it encompasses 
extraordinarily large areas of ignorance  It fails to explain some of the 
basic questions of all  how lifeless chemicals came alive what rules of 
grammer lie behind the genetic code how genes shap and form living things
