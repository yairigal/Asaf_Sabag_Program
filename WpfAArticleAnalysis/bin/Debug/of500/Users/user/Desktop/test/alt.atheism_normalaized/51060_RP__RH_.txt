                          An Introduction to Atheism 
                       by mathew 
 
This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism  Whilst I 
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you 
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  I 
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some 
relevant books are listed in a companion article 
 
To provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this article 
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  All the 
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped 
up repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  Some other 
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article 
 
Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions 
posed from a Christian viewpoint  This is because the FAQ files reflect 
questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christians 
who proselytize on altatheism 
 
So when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such as 
Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine 
being  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it 
may not 
 
What is atheism 
 
Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God 
Some atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former is 
often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong 
atheism 
 
It is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weak 
atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strong 
atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do not 
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists 
 
Some atheists believe in the nonexistence of all Gods others limit their 
atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than making 
flatout denials 
 
But isnt disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesnt exist 
 
Definitely not  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe 
it to be true  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent
