	Is this Zenos Paradox Nothing can get out of a black hole because 
the escape velocity is the speed of light I dont know how time dialation 
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon Can any 
one explain how matter gets in 
 
	I hope that it was clear that a black hole can lose mass to its 
surroundings via the socalled Hawking rediation This is the idea that 
virtual partical pairs can form so close to the event horizen that one 
of the pair is trapped and the other goes free The conservation of 
energy requires that the black hole lose mass albeit very slowly that 
that if primordial black holes were formed the ones about the size of 
small asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of our 
universe The story goes that we should be able to see the flashes caused 
by the explosions that result at the end of these black holes Does this 
idea still hold promise or has it been debunked
