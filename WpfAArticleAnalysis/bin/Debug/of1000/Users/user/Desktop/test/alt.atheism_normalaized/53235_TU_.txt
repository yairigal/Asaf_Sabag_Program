WELL, THAT'S THE QUESTION, ISN'T IT?  THE GOALS ARE PROBABLY NOT ALL THAT
OBVIOUS.  WE CAN SET UP A FEW GOALS, LIKE HAPPINESS AND LIBERTY AND
THE GOLDEN RULE, ETC.  BUT THESE GOALS AREN'T INHERENT.  THEY HAVE TO
BE DEFINED BEFORE AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE.

IT IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT, ONE YOU HAVE GOALS IN MIND, AND ABSOLUTE
KNOWELDGE OF EVERYONE'S INTENT, ETC.

>>NOW YOU ARE LETTING AN OMNISCIENT BEING GIVE INFORMATION TO ME.  THIS
>>WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL PREMISE.

OMNISCIENCE IS FINE, AS LONG AS INFORMATION IS NOT GIVEN AWAY.  ISN'T
THIS THE RESOLUTION OF THE FREE WILL PROBLEM?  AN INTERACTIVE OMNISCIENT
BEING CHANGES THE SITUATION.

>>WHICH TYPE OF MORALITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  IN A NATURAL SENSE, IT
>>IS NOT AT ALL IMMORAL TO HARM ANOTHER SPECIES (AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
>>ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR OWN, I GUESS).
>I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MORALITY INTRODUCED BY YOU, WHICH WAS GOING TO

>YOU TELL US WHAT TYPE OF MORALITY THAT IS.

WELL, I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM IN GENERAL.  I DIDN'T
MENTION A SPECIFIC GOAL, WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE
MORALITY OF AN ACTION.
