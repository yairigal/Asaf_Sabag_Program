Exactly  Although this may be a dissapointing answer there has to be an 
interplay of the two  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality  A persons 
selfgeneratedlearned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely 
mentalverbal level and dont usually find expression in society except in an 
impure not in the sense of bad   state  Sometimes this has to be so

Also what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society in a very 
real sense  To use the obvious example there is a political society and a 
racial society and a gender society and sometimes they do not always agree on 
every issue

Yes  Perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesnt hurt 
others  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do it 
is not a morality in that it doesnt propound any specifically preferred 
behaviours

Ill add a hearty me two  However one could just as well say just because 
certain actions are moral does not make them legal one still doesnt really 
get an impression of which one is truly right
