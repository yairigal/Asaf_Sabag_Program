INDEED.  BUT THAT CODE IS LAW, NOT MORALITY.  I THINK THE POINT HERE WAS NOT 
A DISCUSSION OF ANARCHY VS. LAW.  I THINK THAT MOST SEE THE BENEFIT OF A NON-
ANARCHISTIC SYSTEM.  OUR INCREDIBLY HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING IS BASED ON 
TECHNOLOGY, DERIVED FROM AN ORDERED EXISTANCE.  WE WOULN'T HAVE GOT FAR IF 
WE WERE STILL BASHING EACH OTHER OVER THE HEAD WITH CLUBS, RIGHT?

THE QUESTION BECOMES, IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN ORDERED SOCIETY IN WHICH 
THE LAWS ARE RECOGNIZED TO BE IN PLACE BASED ON _ENLIGHTENED SELF INTEREST_ 
AS OPPOSED TO MORALITY? 

AND SECONDLY, ASSUMING A SATISFACTORY _LEGAL_ CODE IS IN PLACE, AND WE 
CHOOSE TO PERSUE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, IS A _MORAL 
CODE_ REQUIRED OR EVEN ACCEPTABLE?

CAN AN AGREEMENT EVER BE REACHED?  AT WHAT POINT DO WE START TO COMPRIMISE?

THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS IN LIGHT OF SOME RECENT SOCIAL ISSUES:

	TOPIC			LEGAL?		     MORAL?
	
	HOMOSEXUALITY 		YES		(INSERTOPINIONHERE)
	DRUG USE		NO		      DITTO
	PROSTITUTION		NO (GEN.)	      DITTO
	ABORTION		YES (GEN.)	      DITTO
	PRAYER IN SCHOOL	NO (GEN.)	      DITTO
	TABACCO TAXATION :-)	YES		      DITTO
	SPANKING :-)		YES		      DITTO
	READING NEWS :-)	YES		       NO

YOU MILAGE MAY VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR STATE/COUNTRY! :-)
ENJOY!
