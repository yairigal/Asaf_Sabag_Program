Why not die for a lie  If you were poverty stricken and alunatic sounds 
perfecetly reasoable to me  As to whether the societal dregs he had for 
followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not not necessarily

There is no historical proof of this see earlier threads  Besides he or at 
least his name have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever 
healing he gave
