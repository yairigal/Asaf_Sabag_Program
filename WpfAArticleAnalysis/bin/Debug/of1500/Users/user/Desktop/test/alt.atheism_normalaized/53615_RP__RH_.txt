This is simply complete nonsense The basis for matters of fact is 
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion 
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge 
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is 
 
The *basis* Eric is people peering at the world and saying what 
they see  Im talking about uninterpreted facts  observations  People 
do those  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory 
that is more than personal

Opinions about raw facts as you call them are somewhat different 
than interpretations of those raw facts 
 
I know this  You know this  Can we proceed

That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to 
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to 
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good 
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says 
 
Youre not comparing apples with apples  If we all look at the same meter 
well agree  If were all in the same situation thats when well 
agree on fundamental values if at all  People who say that nobody agrees on 
values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem 
to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either

See above We cant seem to agree on whats better 
 
See above  We sometimes can  There is also the matter of inertia 
against experimentation  Most if not all moral hypotheses are necessarily 
tested by way of thought experiment  Few people will attempt genocide 
or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if its really as bad as  
all that

I dont see that its any evidence at all 
As I point out above Im really not interested very much in 
what the popular opinion is Im prepared to trustto some extent 
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation 
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone 
else said the dial read 15 and it looked like a 3 to me I would 
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about 
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting 
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists 
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree 
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion 
about good from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion 
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get 
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations 
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually 
 
Firstly if everyone else said the dial was 15 and I saw 3 Id check 
my lens prescription  Secondly your observation that people 
disagree shows nothing  people may be looking at different things 
by virtue of being in different situations  If I look at an elephant Ill  
see an elephant  That doesnt imply that you will see an elephant if you  
look at an iguana    Thirdly I question your assumption that when 
people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals that  
they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals that seems to be the  
disagreement you refer to
