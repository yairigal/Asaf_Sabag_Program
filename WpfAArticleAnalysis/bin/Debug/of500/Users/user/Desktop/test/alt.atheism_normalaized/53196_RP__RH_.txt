Thats not true    I gave you two examples   One was the rather 
pevasive antisemitism in German Christianity well before Hitler 
arrived   The other was the system of social ranks that were used 
in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest  
of the population 
 
Neither of these were very terrible in themselves but both helped 
to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews 
was made easier
