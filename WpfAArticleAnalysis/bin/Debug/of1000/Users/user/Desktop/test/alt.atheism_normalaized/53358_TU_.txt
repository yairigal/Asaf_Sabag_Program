WHICH NEWSGROUP HAVE YOU BEEN READING?  THE FEW ANTI-CHRISTIAN POSTS ARE
VIRTUALLY ALL IN RESPONSE TO SOME CHRISTIAN POSTING SOME "YOU WILL ALL
BURN IN HELL" KIND OF DRIVEL.

BAKE, IT IS TRANSPARENTLY OBVIOUS THAT YOU ARE A THEIST PRETENDING TO BE
AN ATHEIST.  YOU PROBABLY THINK YOU ARE VERY CLEVER, BUT WE SEE THIS ALL

BUT OF COURSE *YOU* HAVE DISMISSED THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ATHEIST,
RIGHT?
 
>...JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RELIGION, HARD ATHEISM IS A FAITH.
 
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU *DIDN'T* READ THE FAQ AFTER ALL.
