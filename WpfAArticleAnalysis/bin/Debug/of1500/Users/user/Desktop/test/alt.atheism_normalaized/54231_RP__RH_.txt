I dont think Ive changed my stance at all  My original stance was that 
a painless execution was not a cruel one  I didnt say what would be 
considered cruel only that a painless death wasnt  Now cruelty must 
involve some sort of suffering I believe  I dont think someone that gets 
shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much  Even a hanging 
probably produces one sharp instance of pain but its over so quickly

No  Well again I stated that a painless death isnt cruel but I dont 
think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel  I think that some 
are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain 
 
>By the way how long is too long 
 
Anything more than an instant I guess  Any death by suffocation 
asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this includes the 
gas chamber and drawing and quartering  Id say that any pain that 
lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may 
be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose
