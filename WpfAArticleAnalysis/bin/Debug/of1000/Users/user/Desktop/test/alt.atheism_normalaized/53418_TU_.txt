	IS THIS ZENO'S PARADOX? NOTHING CAN GET OUT OF A BLACK HOLE BECAUSE
THE ESCAPE VELOCITY IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TIME DIALATION
CAN PREVENT MATTER SPIRALING IN FROM GETTING TO THE EVENT HORIZON. CAN ANY-
ONE EXPLAIN HOW MATTER GETS IN.

	I HOPE THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT A BLACK HOLE CAN LOSE MASS TO ITS
SURROUNDINGS VIA THE SO-CALLED HAWKING REDIATION. THIS IS THE IDEA THAT
VIRTUAL PARTICAL PAIRS CAN FORM SO CLOSE TO THE EVENT HORIZEN THAT ONE
OF THE PAIR IS TRAPPED AND THE OTHER GOES FREE. THE CONSERVATION OF
ENERGY REQUIRES THAT THE BLACK HOLE LOSE MASS, ALBEIT VERY SLOWLY, THAT
THAT IF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WERE FORMED, THE ONES ABOUT THE SIZE OF
SMALL ASTERIODS SHOULD BE EVAPORATING ABOUT NOW IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
UNIVERSE. THE STORY GOES THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE FLASHES CAUSED
BY THE EXPLOSIONS THAT RESULT AT THE END OF THESE BLACK HOLES. DOES THIS
IDEA STILL HOLD PROMISE, OR HAS IT BEEN DEBUNKED.
