+LAST NIGHT, WHILE WATCHING THE 2A.M. REBROADCAST OF JERRY SPRINGER (A
+TALK SHOW) I HEARD THIS JEWEL OF A THOUGHT FROM A 12 YEAR OLD RACIST. 
+THE FOCUS OF THIS SHOW WAS ON THESE KIDS AND THEIR HATRED FOR THE JEWISH
+RELIGION, AND WHY.  

[SOME STUFF DELETED]

+INTERESTING (AND SCARY) NO?  THEY WENT ON TO SAY HOW THE JEWS HAD 
+KILLED THEIR GOD, AND HOW IN THE END OF TIME THAT ALL THE RACES WOULD
+GO TO THEIR HOMELANDS (OF COURSE, THEY WOULD REMAIN IN AMERICA, WHICH
+IS NEW JERUSELEM, AS IT SAYS IN GEN 2??? (WHAT ANOTHER KID SAID) BUT
+THE REST OF THE RACES WOULD GO HOME) AND THEN THE GREAT BATTLE OR PLAGUE
+OR WHATEVER REVEL. SAYS WOULD HAPPEN, AND THE JEWS WOULD BE KILLED.
+
+THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS WAS THAT MY ROOMATE IS CATHOLIC, 
+AND HAD THE KJV OF THE BIBLE ON HIS DESK.  HE IMMEDIATLY OPENED IT UP
+AND BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE QUOTED PASSAGES (GEN, REV, AND JOHN) TO 
+LOOK FOR HIMSELF, AND COULDN'T FIND WHAT THEY SAID THEY SAW.  I DON'T
+KNOW

I SAW THIS SHOW A WHILE BACK, AND WHEN I HEARD THESE KIDS
QUOTE THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THEIR RACIST CLAIMS, I LOOKED UP
THAT QUOTE ABOUT JESUS HATING JEWS (SINCE JESUS HIMSELF WAS A
JEW, MY CURIOUSITY HAD BEEN PIQUED BY SUCH A CLAIM).
THE JIST OF THE PASSAGE (AND I AM SORRY BUT I CAN'T RECALL
WHICH PASSAGE IT WAS EXACTLY) WAS THAT JESUS WAS CONDEMNING
THE PHARISEES FOR BEING CORRUPT.
OF COURSE, THE PHARISEES WERE JEWISH TOO, BUT IT WASN'T JEWS
AS A WHOLE THAT JESUS WAS CONDEMNING, JUST THE POWERS THAT BE.
