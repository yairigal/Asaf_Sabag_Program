"TO PUT IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE: *I AM NOT A MUSLIM*.[...] I DO NOT
 ACCEPT THE CHARGE OF APOSTACY, BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER IN MY ADULT LIFE
 AFFIRMED ANY BELIEF, AND WHAT ONE HAS NOT AFFIRMED ONE CAN NOT BE
 SAID TO HAVE APOSTASIZED FROM.  THE ISLAM I KNOW STATES CLEARLY THAT
 'THERE CAN BE NO COERCION IN MATTERS OF RELIGION'.  THE MANY MUSLIMS
 I RESPECT WOULD BE HORRIFIED BY THE IDEA THAT THEY BELONG TO THEIR
 FAITH *PURELY BY VIRTUE OF BIRTH*, AND THAT A PERSON WHO FREELY CHOSE
 NOT TO BE A MUSLIM COULD THEREFORE BE PUT TO DEATH."

"GOD, SATAN, PARADISE, AND HELL ALL VANISHED ONE DAY IN MY FIFTEENTH
 YEAR, WHEN I QUITE ABRUPTLY LOST MY FAITH.  [...]AND AFTERWARDS, TO
 PROVE MY NEW-FOUND ATHEISM, I BOUGHT MYSELF A RATHER TASTELESS HAM
 SANDWICH, AND SO PARTOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME OF THE FORBIDDEN FLESH OF
 THE SWINE.  NO THUNDERBOLT ARRIVED TO STRIKE ME DOWN. [...] FROM THAT
 DAY TO THIS I HAVE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A WHOLLY SECULAT PERSON."

ONLY A FUNCTIONAL ILLITERATE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONCEPTION OF THE
NATURE OF THE NOVEL COULD THINK SUCH A THING.  I'LL ACCEPT IT
(RELUCTANTLY) FROM MOBS IN PAKISTAN, BUT NOT FROM YOU.  WHAT IS
PRESENTED IN THE FICTIONAL DREAM OF A DEMENTED CHARACTER CANNOT BY THE
WILDEST STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BE CONSIDERED A REFLECTION ON THE
ACTUAL MOHAMMAD.  WHAT'S WORSE, THE NOVEL DOESN'T PRESENT THE
MAHOUND/MOHAMMED CHARACTER IN ANY WORSE LIGHT THAN SECULAR HISTORIES
OF ISLAM; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS NO "LEWD" MISREPRESENTATION OF HIS
LIFE OR THAT OF HIS WIVES.

>THAT IS WHY
>FEW PEOPLE RUSH TO HIS DEFENSE -- HE'S CONSIDERED AN ABSOLUTE FOOL FOR 
>HIS WRITINGS IN _THE SATANIC VERSES_. 

DON'T HOLD BACK; HE'S CONSIDERED AN APOSTATE AND A BLASPHEMER.
HOWEVER, IT'S NOT FOR HIS WRITING IN _THE SATANIC VERSES_, BUT FOR
WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED AS A PROPAGANDISTIC VERSION OF WHAT IS
CONTAINED IN THAT BOOK.  I HAVE YET TO FIND *ONE SINGLE MUSLIM* WHO
HAS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY HAVE READ THE BOOK.  SOME HAVE INITIALLY
CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE SO, BUT NONE HAS SHOWN MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOOK
THAN A SUPERFICIAL NEWSWEEK STORY MIGHT IMPART, AND ALL HAVE MADE
FACTUAL MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT EVENTS IN THE BOOK.

>IF YOU WISH TO UNDERSTAND THE
>REASONS BEHIND THIS AS WELL HAS THE ORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT OF "THE
>SATANIC VERSES" [...] SEE THE
>PENGUIN PAPERBACK BY RAFIQ ZAKARIYAH CALLED _MOHAMMAD AND THE QURAN_.

I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT.  I HAVE A COUNTER-PROPOSAL: I SUGGEST
THAT YOU SEE THE VIKING HARDCOVER BY SALMAN RUSHDIE CALLED _THE
SATANIC VERSES_.  PERHAPS THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.
