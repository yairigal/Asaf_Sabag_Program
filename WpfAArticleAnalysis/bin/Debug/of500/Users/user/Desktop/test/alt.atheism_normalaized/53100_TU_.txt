NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT OBJECTIVE, BUT THEY DON'T EVEN STAY CONSTANT
OVER TIME.   A YOUNG FARMER AND AN OLD FARMER ON THE VERGE OF 
RETIREMENT HAVE QUITE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE RELATIVE VALUES OF 
A PIECE OF LAND AND A DOLLAR BILL.

SIMILARLY, A PERSON VIEWING AN ANONYMOUS PIECE OF LAND, AND A 
PERSON VIEWING A PIECE OF LAND THAT HIS FAMILY HAS LIVED ON FOR
GENERATIONS.

THESE VALUES ARE ESSENTIALLY SUBJECTIVE, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
MARKETS: TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MATCH THEIR VALUATIONS OF LAND AND
DOLLAR BILLS.
