My point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe  Saying  
that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and  
counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups  I see in your posts a  
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don 
t believe exactly as you do  If youre here to try to convert the atheists  
here youre failing miserably  Who wants to be in position of constantly  
defending themselves agaist insulting attacks like you seem to like to do 
Im sorry youre so blind that you didnt get the messgae in the quote  
everyone else has seemed to
