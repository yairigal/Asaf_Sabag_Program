 * The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *

  I have a few points to make about the above posting 
 
    1 Science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either 
    real or alleged experts  Critical reasoning evidence and if possible 
    experimentation are necessary  Creationists frequently display a massive 
    confusion about this by merely quoting both nonexperts and experts alike 
    some of the latter quotes are in fact false and steadfastly refusing to 
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure  This strongly suggests 
    that a their claims completely lack any scientific merit and b they 
    are aware of this fatal deficiency  Of course you may not actually be a 
    creationist and this may not be your real intent 
 
    2 You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his 
    statement  Why is that  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the 
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology 
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context 
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate 
    scientists  Of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may 
    not be your real intent 
 
    3 Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of 
    evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one 
    line quote from an unidentified nobody  It is also important to note that 
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate 
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck 
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid  Creationists seem rather fond 
    of diving head first into this logical fallacy  Of course you may not 
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent
