SUMMARY: I BELIEVE MAHARISHI IS A TITLE.

-*----
I WROTE:
>> THE DIARIES OF THE FOLLOWERS OF THE MAHARISHI, FORMERLY OF

IN ARTICLE <2944756297.1.P00261@PSILINK.COM> "ROBERT KNOWLES" <P00261@PSILINK.COM> WRITES:

I BELIEVE THAT MAHARISHI IS TITULAR.  (SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF 
I AM WRONG.)  THUS, MAHARISHI RAJNEESH IS A DIFFERENT PERSON FROM
MAHARISHI MAHESH, BUT THEY ARE BOTH MAHARISHIS.
