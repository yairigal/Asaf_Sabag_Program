Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws 
However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all 
five schools of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be levelled against 
muslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam I do 
not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and 
open hostility to Islam falls into this category of the law I do know 
that 
historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone 
by the death penalty 
 
My understanding is that Khomeinis ruling was not based on the 
law of apostasy alone It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate 
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no 
precedent in the Quran hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly 
levelling death penalties for apostasy 
 
I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad This 
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an 
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals The reward was 
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran

I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember was 
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication 
of the book However the charge of fasad can encompass a 
number of lesser charges I remember that when diplomatic relations 
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa  Iran stressed that 
the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from 
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the 
crisis But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not 
the main thrust behind the fatwa Islamic charges such as fasad
