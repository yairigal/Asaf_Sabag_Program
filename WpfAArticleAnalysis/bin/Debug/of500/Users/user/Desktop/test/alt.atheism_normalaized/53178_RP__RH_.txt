I dont feel that Im preaching Im just trying to answer peoples  
questions and talking about my religion my beliefs 
When it comes to what I post I dont do it with the intent of converting  
anyone  I dont expect for the atheists in this newsgroup to take what I  
say with a grain of salt if they so wish 
I just state what I beleve they ask me how I believeit and why and we all  
go on  
If thats preaching then Im soory and Ill get off the soapbox
