>Merely a question for the basis of morality 
 
>MoralEthical behavior = Societally acceptable behavior 
 
>1Who is society 
 
Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under selfdefined 
rules  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented 
at the UN are considered part of that society If we then look at US federal 
laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for 
that case would be the citizens of the US and so on 
 
>2How do they define what is acceptable 
 
Acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the 
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are 
nonverbally and in effect nonconsciously such as picking your nose on 
the Oprah Winfrey show noone does it but there is no explicit law against 
doing it In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a 
behaviour is acceptable but one can deduce these behaviours by 
observation 
 
 
>3How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position 
 
In an increasingly litigation mad society this trap is becoming exceedingly 
difficult to avoid With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures 
in American and Australian to bring in my local perspective culture the 
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may 
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour For instance some 
cultures dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals 
Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent However is 
it moral according to the multicultural american society This kind of 
problem may only be definable by legislation  
 
Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is 
acceptable behaviour or not and much of this will be due to different 
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions   
 
One thing is for sure there is no universal moral code which will suit all 
cultures in all situations  There may however be some globally accepted 
mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable 
concept The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon 
this earth are living in a similar environment if that ever happens
