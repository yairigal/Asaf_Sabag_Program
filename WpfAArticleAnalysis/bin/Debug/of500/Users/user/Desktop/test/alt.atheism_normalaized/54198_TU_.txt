YOU WERE A LIBERAL ARTS MAJOR, WEREN'TCHA?

GUESS YOU NEVER SAW THAT PHOTO OF THE SMALLEST LOGO IN THE WORLD--
"IBM" MADE WITH NOBLE GAS ATOMS (KRYPTON? XENON? I FORGET THE
SPECIFICS).

ATOMS, TREES, ELECTRONS ARE ALL INDEPENDENTLY OBSERVABLE AND
VERIFIABLE. MORALS AREN'T. SEE THE DIFFERENCE?

MEN WHO LOVE BROWN TEND TO BE WARM AND DEEP, SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS AND
DESIRES OF THEIR PARTNERS. SEX IS A 24 HOUR A DAY THING. SNUGGLING BY
THE FIRE, WALKING IN THE RAIN OR CATCHING SNOWFLAKES ON THEIR TONGUE IS
A REAL TURN-ON TO A LOVER OF BROWN. (THANX BECKA!)
