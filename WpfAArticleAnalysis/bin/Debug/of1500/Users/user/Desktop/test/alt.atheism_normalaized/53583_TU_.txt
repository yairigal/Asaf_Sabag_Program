WHAT I MEAN IS WHAT I SAID.   "WHAT I WANT" DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY
TRANSLATE INTO "WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT."   THAT IS, IT DOES NOT 
TRANSLATE THAT WAY FOR ME.

IF YOU REPLY THAT "I THINK IT IS OK TO KILL YOU BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT 
I DECIDED" THEN WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT FOR YOU "WHAT I WANT" DOES
TRANSLATE INTO "WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT".

IT JUST DOESN'T TRANSLATE THAT WAY FOR ME.
