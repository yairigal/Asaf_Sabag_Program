abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing 
 
SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF 
 
The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or 
proposition  Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad 
ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who 
denies or questions the assertion being made  The source of the fallacy is 
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise 
 
STRAW MAN 
 
The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that it 
can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position 
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished  It is a 
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been 
made 
 
THE EXTENDED ANALOGY 
 
The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general 
rule is being argued over  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  
different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a  
claim that those situations are analogous to each other 
 
This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  
anticryptography legislation 
 
I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it 
 
Such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported 
 Martin Luther King 
 
Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the 
 struggle for Black liberation  How dare you 
 
TU QUOQUE 
 
This is the famous you too fallacy  It occurs when an action is argued to 
be acceptable because the other party has performed it  For instance 
 
Youre just being randomly abusive 
So  Youve been abusive too
