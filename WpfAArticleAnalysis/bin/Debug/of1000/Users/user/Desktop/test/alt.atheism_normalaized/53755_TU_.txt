NO, I SAY RELIGIOUS LAW APPLIES TO THOSE WHO ARE CATEGORIZED AS
BELONGING TO THE RELIGION WHEN EVENT BEING JUDGED APPLIES. THIS
PREVENTS SITUATIONS IN WHICH SOMEONE IS A MEMBER OF A RELIGION
WHO, WHEN CHARGED, CLAIMS THAT HE/SHE WAS _NOT_ A MEMBER OF THE
RELIGION SO THEY ARE FREE TO GO ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.
