I HATE DOING THIS, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE, BUT...

EVOLUTION, IN THE NONSCIENTIFIC SENSE, IS CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH IT IS
OFTEN USED IN A COLLOQUIAL MANNER TO REFER TO PHENOMENA THAT TEND
TOWARD HIGHER COMPLEXITY AND ABILITY, EVOLUTION SIMPLY IMPLIES CHANGE,
FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD.  IN THE SCIENTIFIC SENSE, EVOLUTION IS MERELY THE
CHANGE IN ALLELE FREQUENCIES FOR A GIVEN POPULATION OVER A PERIOD OF
TIME.  THIS IS USUALLY WHAT PEOPLE REFER TO WHEN THEY DISCUSS THE
SCIENTIFIC FACT OF EVOLUTION.  WE OBSERVE SUCH SHIFTS IN ALLELE
FREQUENCIES OCCURRING ALL THE TIME, SO IT IS TRIVIAL TO CONCLUDE THAT
EVOLUTION IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.

THE MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE SUCH CHANGES IN ALLELE FREQUENCIES ARE
COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.  DARWIN'S NATURAL
SELECTION IS ONE SUCH THEORY.  GENETIC DRIFT IS ANOTHER.  GENE FLOW IS
STILL ANOTHER.

EVOLUTION IS A FACT AND A THEORY.  (I POSTED LARRY MORAN'S LENGTHY
ARTICLE ON THIS TOPIC A COUPLE DAYS AGO.  WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK AND
READ IT?)
