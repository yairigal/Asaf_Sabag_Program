To be fair you should really qualify this as semiticwestern religions but 
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway

Again this should really be evaluated at a personal level  For example there 
was only one Jesus presumably and he probably didnt say all that many 
things and yet seemingly billions and billions of Christian sects have 
arisen  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and 
believes in Christ as in pantheism  It would seem to go against the Bible but 
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal 
interpretation

This is a good point  We have here the quintessential Christian he sets up a 
system of valuesbeliefs for himself which work very well and every 
eventexperience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this 
system  However we also have an individual who has the inability at least 
not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem 
with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to 
the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system 
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all 
the tests fail  In other words the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate 
moralities without the biasresponsibility of losingretaining a system

Interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual 
nuances although not always I will admit and probably it is the 
massoriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant 
unfortunately

In which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun 
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if I 
may be so bold as to extend your similie
