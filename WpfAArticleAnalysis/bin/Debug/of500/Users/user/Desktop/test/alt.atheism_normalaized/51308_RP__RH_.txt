Im not saying this at all  it requires no faith on my part to 
say the car drives because Ive seen it drive  Ive done more 
than at in fact  Ive actually driven it now what does require 
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation 
of whats out there But there is NO evidence  pro or con  
for the existence or nonexistence of God see what I have to 
say below on this

Sorry if I remain skeptical  I dont believe its entirely a 
conclusion That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God 
is correct  neither have I But lack of evidence for the existence  
of something is in NO WAY evidence for the nonexistence of something  
the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  
disprove evolution the establish creation You personally have never  
seen a neutrino before but they exist The pink unicorn analogy breaks 
down and is rather naive I have a scientific theory that explains the  
appearance of animal life  evolution When I draw the conclusion that  
pink unicorns dont exist because I havent seen them this conclusion 
has its foundation in observation and theory A pink unicorn if 
it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities 
That is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has 
evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share  
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such God however 
has no such correspondence with anything IMO There is no physical
