No Bobby  Stalin killed millions in the name of Socialism  Atheism was a 
characteristic of the LeninStalin version of Socialism nothing more 
Another characteristic of LeninStalin Socialism was the centralization of 
food distribution  Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed 
millions in the name of rationing bread  Of course not 
 
 
>More horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else 
 
In earlier posts you stated that true Muslim believers were incapable of 
evil  I suppose if you believe that you could reason that no one has ever 
been killed in the name of religion  What a perfect world you live in

Bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in The Good Atheists  
Handbook 
 
Law XXVIA3 Give that which you do not believe in a face   
 
You must excuse us Bobby  When we argue against theism we usually argue 
against the Christian idea of God  In the realm of Christianity man was 
created in Gods image
