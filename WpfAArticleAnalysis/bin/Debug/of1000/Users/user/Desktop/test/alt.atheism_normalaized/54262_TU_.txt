I WOULD GUESS THAT YOU EITHER MEAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
SWEARING ALIGANCE TO A NON-EXISTANT BEING OR THAT YOU ARE BEING
DELIBERATILY DENSE (CONSIDERING WHAT GROUP THIS IS).  

IT DOESN'T COME "QUITE NATURALLY" TO NONBELIEVERS SUCH AS MYSELF
OR EVEN TO FOLLOWERS OF OTHER RELIGIONS.  WOULD YOU SAY IT WOULD
BE QUITE NATURAL IF YOU WERE FORCED TO SWEAR BY "ALLAH" OR
"BUDDA"?
