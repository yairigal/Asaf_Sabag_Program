}WHY WOULD THE NT NOT BE CONSIDERED A GOOD SOURCE.  THIS MIGHT BE A 
}LITERARY/HISTORICAL QUESTION, BUT WHEN I STUDIED HISTORY I ALWAYS LOOKED FOR 
}FIRSTHAND ORIGINAL SOURCES TO WRITE MY PAPERS.

IF I WANT TO CHECK THE ORIGINAL NEW TESTAMENT MANUSCRIPTS FOR POSSIBLE COPYING
ERRORS OR MISTRANSLATIONS, WHICH MUSEUM WOULD I HAVE TO VISIT?  IF I WANTED
TO DO THIS FOR _ALICE IN WONDERLAND_, I'D VISIT THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHERE I
WOULD FIND THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT AND BE ABLE TO COMPARE IT TO THE PRINTED
EDITION THAT I OWN (I'D FIND MANY DIFFERENCES INCLUDING A DIFFERENT TITLE).
LIKEWISE, IF I HAD A CAST OF _ARCHAEOPTERYX_, I COULD TAKE IT TO BERLIN TO
COMPARE IT TO THE ORIGINAL FOSSIL FOUND AT SOLENHOFEN.
