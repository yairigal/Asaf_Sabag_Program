    Isnt there one of the ten commandments that says something like you 
shall not bear false witness  And doesnt quoting someone in a way that 
completely inverts what they were trying to say constitute bearing false 
witness  Doesnt this cause you any internal conflict at all 
 
    I ask this because I am a Christian and I am very perturbed to see the 
creationscience camp use what I would characterize as sleazy tactics in 
order to try to win the debate  There is a long tradition of Christian 
thought that maintains that an essential Christian ethic is that the end does 
not justify the means  In other words HOW you do something is as important 
as what it is intended to accomplish  I dont think that using misquoted 
excerpts from people who disagree with you brings very much glory to God 
do you
