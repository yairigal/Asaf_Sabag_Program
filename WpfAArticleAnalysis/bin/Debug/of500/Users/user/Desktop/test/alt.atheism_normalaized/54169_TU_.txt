>>>WHY IS THE NT TOSSED OUT AS INFO ON JESUS.  I REALIZE IT IS NORMALLY TOSSED

BRUCE HITS THE MAIN POINT SIMPLY -- AS RUSSELL TURPIN DOES IN MORE DETAIL
IN HIS RESPONSE.  *ALL* SOURCES ARE, IN MODERN HISTORIOGRAPHY, TO BE USED
CRITICALLY, WHICH IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT ANY CLAIMS DERIVING FROM THEM ARE
SUBJECT TO *SPECIFIC* EXAMINATION IN THE LIGHT OF MOTIVES AND OTHER HUMAN
CONSIDERATIONS (AS WELL AS THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND).  THE CRITICAL METHOD
APPLIES BOTH TO THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT AND TO THE USES MADE OF IT BY OTHERS
(MOST EMPHATICALLY *INCLUDING* THE HISTORICAL RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES.)

>WOULDN'T THEY BE A BETTER "REPORTER" THAN SOMEONE WHO HEARD ABOUT IT SECOND 
>HAND?  I GUESS ISN'T FIRSTHAND BETTER THAN SECOND HAND.  I KNOW, THERE IS BIAS,
>AND WINNERS WRITING HISTORY, BUT DOESN'T THE PRINCIPLE OF FIRSTHAND BEING BEST
>STILL APPLY?

BUT GIVEN THE CRITICAL PRINCIPLE, WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT WE HAVE
ANYTHING AT ALL FROM "FIRSTHAND" SOURCES ABOUT JESUS?  PAUL'S LETTERS ARE
INDEED FIRSTHAND EVIDENCE ABOUT PAUL AND HIS INTERACTIONS.  THEY ARE, AS
A RESULT, THE MOST HISTORICALLY SOLID BOOKS IN THE NT.  PAUL'S CLAIMS AND
DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT HIS CONFLICTS WITH JERUSALEM MAY NOT BE "WIE ES EIGENT-
LICH GEWESEN" -- BUT THEY ARE MOST DEFINITELY THE COMMENTS OF A PARTICIPANT!
IN OTHER WORDS, WE'D EVALUATE PAUL'S STATEMENTS MORE OR LESS AS WE WOULD
THE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS IN COURT.

THE GOSPELS ARE ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER.  LUKE IS MOST ASSUREDLY NOT A
FIRSTHAND WITNESS.  HE *CLAIMS* TO HAVE GATHERED MATERIAL THAT IS CLOSER
TO THE ACTUAL EVENTS -- BUT THIS IS A CONVENTIONAL CLAIM IN ANCIENT BOOKS
AND LUKE IN FACT NEVER NAMES A WITNESS OR POINTS TO ANY ONE THING IN HIS
BOOK(S) WHICH DERIVE FROM ANY SOURCE *WE* CAN DETECT BEHIND LUKE.  JOHN
HAS A CONCLUDING REMARK THAT IT DERIVES FROM THE TESTIMONY OF A BELOVED
DISCIPLE (WHO IS NOT NAMED.)  WE ARE NOT BOUND TO ACCEPT THIS CLAIM (FOR
A LONG TIME, SOME SCHOLARS REJECTED IT OUTRIGHT), BUT EVEN IF WE DO, IT
MAKES THE FOURTH GOSPEL AS WE HAVE IT *AT BEST* SECONDHAND.  NEITHER MARK
NOR MATTHEW MAKE ANY CLAIMS TO BE FIRSTHAND.  LATER (MUCH LATER) CHRISTIAN
TRADITION ASSOCIATES THE FIRST GOSPLE WITH MATTHEW AND A POSSIBLE ARAMAIC
PROTO-GOSPEL, AND ASSOCIATES MARK WITH PETER AS HAVING SOMETHING LIKE THE
SAME SECOND-HAND STATUS OF RECOUNTING PETER'S PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL.

SUCH TRADITIONAL CLAIMS RUN INTO DIFFICULTIES IF WE TRY TO EVALUATE THE
ACTUAL DATA BEFORE US.  LUKE AND MATTHEW BOTH APPEAR TO USE (DIFFERENTLY!)
AN ANONYMOUS AND NOT OTHERWISE ATTESTED COLLECTION OF _LOGOI_ (WORDS AND
DEEDS) OF JESUS, AS WELL AS TO
