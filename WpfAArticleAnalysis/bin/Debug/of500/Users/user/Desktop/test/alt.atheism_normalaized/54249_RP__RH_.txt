                            FREEENERGY TECHNOLOGY 
                       by Robert E McElwaine Physicist 
           
               Ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a  
          heavierthanair machine could not possibly fly  It would  
          violate the laws of physics  All of the experts and  
          authorities said so  
           
               For example Simon Newcomb declared in 1901  The  
          demonstration that no possible combination of known  
          substances known forms of machinery and known forms of  
          force can be united in a practical machine by which man  
          shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer  
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any  
          physical fact to be  
           
               Fortunately a few SMART people such as the Wright  
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final  
          word  Now we take airplanes for granted except when they  
          crash  
           
               Today orthodox physicists and other scientists
