The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and  
exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  The 
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  
in any other war of comparable size this century  This was due mostly 
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques 
which were technically possible only recently 
 
The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is 
ludicrous  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died 
and they were the ones being targeted  Or do you think that the US 
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians 
Either the smart bombs didnt hit their targets and we know they did 
or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to 
destroying Iraqs military potential  The military mission planners are 
not fools they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war 
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you 
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their 
tyrantdictator

How about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in WW2 
I dont hear you bemoaning them  War is never an exact science but 
with smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage 
of civilian casualties  Sometimes mistakes are made targets are 
misidentified innocents die  Thats war the way it really is 
But the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth 
like its one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is 
worse  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago I know not what 
course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me 
death  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one 
wishes to stay free

Mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here 
You come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although I 
feel sure that was not your intent 
 
So the Iraqi war was wrong eh  Im sure that appeasement would have 
worked better than war just like it did in WW2 eh  I guess we 
shouldnt have fought WW2 either  just think of all those innocent 
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg  How about all the poor  
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  We  
should have just let Hitler take over Europe and youd be speaking 
German instead of English right now 
 
Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped  His kind dont understand 
diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  My only regret is 
that Bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into Baghdad so 
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi peoples sacrifice not to 
mention the 357 Americans who died was for naught  Liberating Kuwait  
was a good thing but wiping Hussein off the map wouldve been better 
 
And as for poor poor Rodney King  Did you ever stop and think *why* 
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty 
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those 
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape 
But the jury looked at *all* the evidence evidence which you and I 
have not seen  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a 
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply 
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind 
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends 
to support in the case against the policemen   
 
Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused 
whether they be criminals or cops  One is not found guilty if there is 
a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position 
to assess the evidence and render a verdict  Anyone else is simply 
succumbing to verbal vigilantism
