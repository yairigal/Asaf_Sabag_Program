Worse  Maybe not but it is definately a violation of the 
rules the US govt supposedly follows  Maybe the others 
should be changed to  But Im not personally as concerned 
about the anthem since I dont come across it in daily 
nearly unavoidable routines

I dont despise the peoplejust their opinions  I meant 
when chatting with the ones who refuse to listen to any idea 
other than their ownthen it just becomes an exercise for 
amusement

>Would you approve of such a motto 
 
No  not unless the only way to get rid of the current one 
was to change it to such as that
