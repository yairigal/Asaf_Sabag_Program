IT APPEARS THAT WALLA WALLA COLLEGE WILL FILL THE SAME ROLE IN ALT.ATHEIST
THAT ALLEGHENY COLLEGE FILLS IN ALT.FAN.DAN-QUAYLE.

CONVERTS TO XTIANITY HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO EXCESSIVELY DARKEN THEIR
PRE-XTIAN PAST, FREQUENTLY FALSELY.  ANYONE WHO EMBARKS ON AN
EFFORT TO "DESTROY" XTIANITY IS SUFFERING FROM DEEP MEGALOMANIA, A
DEFECT WHICH IS NOT CURED BY RELIGIOUS CONVERSION.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE?  DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE??  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!

(SIGH!)  PERHAPS BIG J WAS JUST MISTAKEN ABOUT SOME OF HIS CLAIMS.
PERHAPS HE WAS NORMALLY INSIGHTFUL, BUT HAD A FEW OFF DAYS.  PERHAPS
MANY (MOST?) OF THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO JESUS WERE NOT MADE BY
HIM, BUT WERE PUT INTO HIS MOUTH BY LATER AUTHORS.  OTHER POSSIBILITIES
ABOUND.  SURELY, SOMEONE SERIOUSLY EXAMINING THIS QUESTION COULD
COME UP WITH A DECENT LIST OF POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES, UNLESS THE TASK
IS NOT SERIOUS EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTION (MUCH LESS "DESTROYING"
XTIANITY) BUT RATHER RELIGIOUS SALESMANSHIP.

>	SOME REASONS WHY HE WOULDN'T BE A LIAR ARE AS FOLLOWS.  WHO WOULD 
>DIE FOR A LIE?

HOW MANY GERMANS DIED FOR NAZISM?  HOW MANY RUSSIANS DIED IN THE NAME
OF THE PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP?  HOW MANY AMERICANS DIED TO MAKE THE
WORLD SAFE FOR "DEMOCRACY".  WHAT A SILLY QUESTION!

>WOULDN'T PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR?  PEOPLE 
>GATHERED AROUND HIM AND KEPT DOING IT, MANY GATHERED FROM HEARING OR SEEING

IS EVERYONE WHO PERFORMS A HEALING = GOD?

>TO SOMEONE WHO WAS CRAZY.

IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO "DRAW" AN ENTIRE NATION TO YOU UNLESS YOU 
ARE CRAZY.

>VERY DOUBTFUL, IN FACT REDICULOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE 
>ANYONE WHO IS DRAWN TO DAVID KORESH IS OBVIOUSLY A FOOL, LOGICAL PEOPLE SEE

>	THEREFORE SINCE HE WASN'T A LIAR OR A LUNATIC, HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE

ANYONE WHO IS CONVINCED BY THIS LAUGHABLE LOGIC DESERVES
TO BE A XTIAN.

DON'T BOTHER.  MANY OF THE "PROPHECIES" WERE "FULFILLED" ONLY IN THE
EYES OF XTIAN APOLOGISTS, WHO DISTORT THE MEANING OF ISAIAH AND
OTHER OT BOOKS.
