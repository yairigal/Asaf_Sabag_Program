Good point but it is being immoral in our opinion  We dont let them choose 
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them 
 
  For someone to lay claim to an alternative 
>moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be

I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense but have little basis 
for it as of yet  How far can such a concept be extended 
 
 and 
>thus may be incapable of behaving morally  While someone like Hitler 
>may have believed that his actions were moral we may judge him immoral 
>by our standards 
 
Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but  
not him  After all he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he 
chose  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides heres the buzz  
words on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all  
societies 
 
  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean 
>that we must excuse the murderer 
 
Why not Do we have to be objective suddenly
