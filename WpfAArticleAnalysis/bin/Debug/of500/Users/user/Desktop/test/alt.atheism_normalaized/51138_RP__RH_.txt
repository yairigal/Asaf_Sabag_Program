Im curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve 
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument 
from article length  And the list you have here is of poorer 
quality than most  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an 
online bible I doubt that there will be much problem with 
verses quoted inaccurately  But that isnt the problem here 
 
Ive known a lot of fundamentalists in my life but none who 
denied that there were errors in transmission etc  And many of 
the contradictions here  Solomon having 40000 horse stalls in 
one verse and 4000 in another  are just the sort of 
contradiction that fundies dont have a problem with in my 
experience  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to 
anything more than attacking a straw man 
 
Some of the others are just silly or rely on taking quotes out 
of context or have reasonable explanations  But even the ones 
that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about 
them than what is given here  At the very least some effort 
should be made to understand and respond to the common replies 
given by fundies  Look for example at the research that Dave 
Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre 
That would be an excellent start for an antiinerrancy list that 
would have some teeth  One wellresearched and documented 
contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out 
of context and thrown together in a list 
 
Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to 
make a bible verse salad just dont cut it  Those of us who 
want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing 
as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell

PS You can find some good material at ftprutgersedu in 
pubsocreligionchristianotherscontradictions  The quality 
is very uneven on both sides of the argument it is just a 
compilation of things many people have written but some of 
it would be useful in an antiinerrancy FAQ  After exams I 
might be willing to help put it together
