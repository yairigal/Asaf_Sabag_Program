COMPUTERS ARE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE...OF EVOLUTION WITHOUT "A" CREATOR.
WE DID NOT "CREATE" COMPUTERS.  WE DID NOT CREATE THE SAND THAT GOES
INTO THE SILICON THAT GOES INTO THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THAT GO INTO
PROCESSOR BOARD.  WE TOOK THESE THINGS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IN AN
INTERESTING WAY. JUST LIKE PLANTS "CREATE" OXYGEN USING LIGHT THROUGH 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS.  IT'S A MUCH BIGGER LEAP TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
CREATED "EVERYTHING" FROM NOTHING.  I FIND IT UNFATHOMABLE TO RESORT
TO BELIEVING IN A CREATOR WHEN A MUCH SIMPLER ALTERNATIVE EXISTS: WE
SIMPLY ARE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OUR BEGINNINGS -- IF THERE EVEN
WERE BEGINNINGS AT ALL.  AND THAT'S OK WITH ME.  THE PRESENT KEEPS ME
PERFECTLY BUSY.
