                                   Overview 
 
Welcome to altatheism and altatheismmoderated 
 
This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the 
newsgroups 
 
Many groups of a controversial nature have noticed that new readers often 
come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post 
them to the net  In addition people often request information which has 
been posted time and time again  In order to try and cut down on this the 
altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following 
titles 
 
   1  AltAtheism FAQ Overview for New Readers 
   2  AltAtheism FAQ Introduction to Atheism 
   3  AltAtheism FAQ Frequently Asked Questions FAQ 
   4  AltAtheism FAQ Constructing a Logical Argument 
   5  AltAtheism FAQ Atheist Resources 
 
This is article number 1  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting  The 
others are entirely optional 
 
If you are new to Usenet you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup 
newsannouncenewusers  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With 
the Usenet Community Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet 
and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant  Questions 
concerning how news works are best asked in newsnewusersquestions 
 
If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the Finding 
Stuff section below

These articles are free  Truly free  You may copy them and distribute them 
to anyone you wish  However please send any changes or corrections to the 
author and please do not repost copies of the articles to altatheism it 
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating 
around the network 
 
 
                                Finding Stuff 
 
All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system  Here are 
some suggestions on what to do if you cant find them 
 
1 Check the newsgroup altatheism  Look for subject lines starting with 
   AltAtheism FAQ 
 
2 Check the newsgroup newsanswers for the same subject lines 
 
   If you dont find anything in steps 1 or 2 your news system isnt set up 
   correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the 
   problem 
 
3 If you have anonymous FTP access connect to rtfmmitedu 18172127 
   Go to the directory pubusenetaltatheism and youll find the latest 
   versions of the FAQ files there 
 
   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers  If you 
   need help in using or getting started with FTP send email to 
   mailserverrtfmmitedu with 
 
      send usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq 
 
   in the body 
 
4 There are other sites which also carry newsanswers postings  The article 
   Introduction to the newsanswers newsgroup carries a list of these 
   sites the article is posted regularly to newsanswers 
 
5 If you dont have FTP send mail to mailserverrtfmmitedu 
   consisting of the following lines 
 
      send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources 
      send usenetaltatheismfaq 
      send usenetaltatheismintroduction 
      send usenetaltatheismlogic 
      send usenetaltatheismresources 
 
5 Penultimate resort  Send mail to mailservermantiscouk consisting of 
   the following lines 
 
      send atheismfaqfaqtxt 
      send atheismfaqlogictxt 
      send atheismfaqintrotxt 
      send atheismfaqresourcetxt 
 
   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files 
   Theres other stuff too interesting commands to try are help and 
   send atheismindex 
 
6 Last resort  Mail mathewmantiscouk or post an article to the 
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files  You should only do this 
   if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed its not nice to 
   clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files 
   its better than posting without reading the FAQ though  For instance 
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have  
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files
