Well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways

I dont know  What is wrong  Is it possible for humans to survive for 
a long time in the wild  Yes its possible but it is difficult  Humans 
are a social animal and that is a cause of our success 
 
>>and in order for a group to function effectively it 
>>needs some sort of ethical code

Isnt it  Why dont you think so

No  As noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality 
isnt really destructive to the system  It is a worst neutral

Again the mating practices are something to be reexamined
