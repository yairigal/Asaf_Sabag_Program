Well Ive provided examples to show that the trend was general and you 
or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding 
mating practices etc  I dont think that these few cases are enough to 
disprove the general trend of natural morality  And again the mating 
practices need to be reexamined 
 
>>Try to find immoral nonmatingrelated activities 
>So youre excluding matingrelatedactivities from your natural morality 
 
No but mating practices are a special case  Ill have to think about it 
some more

Indeed  But while the natural system is objective all objective systems 
are not the natural one  So the terms can not be equated  The natural 
system is a subset of the objective ones

I dont claim that homosexuality is immoral  It isnt harmful although 
it isnt helpful either to the mating process  And when you say that 
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom dont you mean bisexuality

This is standard jargon  Read any textbook  The we forms are used 
throughout

Thats right  The goals themselves arent inherent

You could but such would contradict observations

But a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be 
true  I dont think your postulate would be valid

Yes and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work  You think 
they dont  Or are they not good goals
