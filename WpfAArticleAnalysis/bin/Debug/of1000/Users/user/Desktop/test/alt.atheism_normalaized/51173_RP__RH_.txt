Thats your mistake  It would be better for the children if the mother 
raised the child 
 
One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say Mom 
because of the love of their mom  It makes for more virile men 
Compare that with how homos are raised  Do a study and you will get my 
point 
 
But in no way do you have a claim that it would be better if the men 
stayed home and raised the child  That is something false made up by 
feminists that seek a status above men  You do not recognize the fact 
that men and women have natural differences  Not just physically but 
mentally also 
  
Your logic  I didnt say americans were the cause of worlds problems I 
said atheists 
  
Becuase they have no code of ethics to follow which means that atheists 
can do whatever they want which they feel is right  Something totally 
based on their feelings and those feelings cloud their rational 
thinking 
  
Yeah  I didnt say that all atheists are bad but that they could be 
bad or good with nothing to define bad or good 
 
 
  Awright  Bobbys back in all of his shitforbrains glory  Just 
  when I thought hed turned the corner of progress his Thorazine 
  prescription runs out   
 
  Id put him in my kill file but man this is good stuff  I wish 
  I had his staying power 
 
  Fortunately I learned not to take him too seriously longlonglong 
  ago
