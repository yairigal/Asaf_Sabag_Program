Ooooops  Jack you forgot to expunge one part of your new rippedoutofcontext 
quote  Thats the last line  Here Eldridge is talking about disagreement over 
the various theories themes  We all know about that  We also know that 
nobody in the warring camps doubts the fact of evolution  You see if you 
had clipped the last line you could have made it look like even evolutionary 
biologists are doubting the fact of evolution  Thats what you wanted to do  
isnt it  Boy oh boy do you need to sharpen up your quote clippers or what 
 
By the way whats an anthropological parallel
