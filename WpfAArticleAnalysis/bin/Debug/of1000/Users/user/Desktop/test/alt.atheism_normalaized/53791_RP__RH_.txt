What is your reaction to people who claim they were abducted by space aliens 
 
Some of these people say I was abducted experimented on etc 
If we insist that these aliens dont exist is the burden of proof placed on 
us These people can give no hard facts but can give a lot of testimony to 
back up their beliefs 
 
Replace <space aliens> with <big foot> <blue unicorns>  
and we have a larger percentage of the population than I like to think 
about 
 
Sometimes I wonder if reality really is a different experience for everone
