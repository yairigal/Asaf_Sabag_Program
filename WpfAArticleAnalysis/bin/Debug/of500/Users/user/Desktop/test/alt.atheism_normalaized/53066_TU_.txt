: THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT YOUR POST AND OTHERS IN THIS THREAD
: THAT ARE A LITTLE CONFUSING. AN ATHEIST IS ONE FOR WHOM ALL THINGS CAN
: BE UNDERSTOOD AS PROCESSES OF NATURE - EXCLUSIVELY.

THIS DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL ATHEISTS (SEE THE FAQ). HOWEVER,
I (FOR ONE) DO THINK THERE IS NO NEED TO INVOKE ANY DIVINE OR
SPIRITUAL EXPLANATIONS. 

IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TO CLAIM THAT ALL THINGS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD
AS NATURAL PROCESSES, AND TO CLAIM THAT OUR OBSERVATIONS DO NOT
REQUIRE US TO POSTULATE ANY DIVINE INTERVENTION, OR ANYTHING SPIRITUAL,
FOR THAT MATTER. HUMANS ARE NOT OMNIPOTENT, AND NEITHER IS SCIENCE.
HOWEVER, SCIENCE HAS ONE ADVANTAGE THEOLOGY DOESN'T: IT IS SELF-
CORRECTING, WITH NATURE AS ITS JUDGE. 

IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE HOW SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY IS REVEALING A SELF-
CONSISTENT, SIMPLE PICTURE OF OUR UNIVERSE. SCIENCE IS NO LONGER
A BUNCH OF SEPARATE BRANCHES, IT IS ONE. FROM PARTICLE PHYSICS TO
PSYCHOLOGY. AND NO ASPECT OF OUR LIFE, OR OUR UNIVERSE, IS SAFE
FROM ITS STERN AND STONY EYE. NOT EVEN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.

 THERE IS NO NEED
: FOR ANY RECOURSE TO DIVNITY TO DESCRIBE OR EXPLAIN ANYTHING. THERE IS
: NO PURPOSE OR DIRECTION FOR ANY EVENT BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY
: PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, ETC.; EVERYTHING IS RANDOM, NOTHING IS
: DETERMNINED.

ACTUALLY, DETERMINISM VS. INDETERMINISM IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION,
AND SCIENCE CANNOT SAY WHETHER THE WHOLE THING IS ACTUALLY SOMEHOW
SUPERDETERMINISTIC OR NOT. I THINK THE QUESTION DOES NOT HAVE
ANY MEANING, AS FAR AS INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS GO. IF THEIR APPARENT
FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SO FROM THEIR
PERSPECTIVE. BILL, CAN YOU SAY _FOR SURE_ WHETHER YOU HAVE A FREE
WILL OR NOT? 

: THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE OF COURSE AND ALL
: ITS PRODUCTS. THERE IS NOTHING REQUIRING THAT LIFE EVOLVE OR THAT IT
: ACQUIRE INTELLIGENCE, IT'S JUST A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

MAYBE. WHO ARE WE TO TELL? IT SEEMS INTELLIGENCE IS USEFUL - WHEN
DURING THE HISTORY OF EARTH HAS _ONE SPECIES_ BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL
ONE THIRD OF THE WHOLE BIOSPHERE? THIS CAN STILL BE A RESULT OF 
NUMEROUS HAPPY ACCIDENTS OUR GENETIC MACHINERY BLINDLY REPLICATES
AND PRESERVES. EVEN THAT MACHINERY CAN BE RESULT OF THE SAME
PRINCIPLE - ONLY THE SYSTEMS THAT CAN START REPLICATING WILL
SURVIVE, THOSE WHICH DON'T DON'T MAKE IT. (RECOMMENDED READING: T.O)

: FOR AN ATHEIST, NO
: EVENT CAN BE PREFERRED TO ANOTHER OR BE SAID TO HAVE MORE OR LESS
: VALUE THAN ANOTHER IN ANY NATURALISTIC SENSE, AND NO THOUGHT -ABOUT-
: AN EVENT CAN HAVE VALUE. 

FROM WHOSE PERSPECTIVE? I VALUE EVENTS AND THINGS SUBJECTIVELY, FROM
MY PERSPECTIVE. NATURE DOES NOT HAVE VALUES, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE
A PERSPECTIVE - VALUES ARISE FROM AWARENESS. IF I HAVE A SUBJECTIVE
PERSPECTIVE, IT IS EASY TO ASSUME THAT OTHER PEOPLE ALSO DO, AND IF
I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD IT BE LIKE IN THEIR POSITION, I WILL
EVENTUALLY DISCOVER THE
