Of course not I would think that would be great fun not having ever 
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze 
This is not what I got when I believed  I just tried to hide my fear 
of getting punished for something I never was sure of The Bible is 
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure God did 
not answer In the end I found I had been following a mass delusion 
a lie I cant believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint 
of her existence

I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe 
and analyse their position In fact it is amusing to note in this 
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the 
opposite  one should not examine ones belief critically 
 
Ill tell you something I left out of my testimony I posted to this 
group two months ago A day after I finally found out my faith is over 
I decided to try just one more time The same cycle of emotional 
responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only 
a couple of hours I told my friend in a phone that it really works 
thank god just to think about it again when I hung up I had to admit 
that I had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion

I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger or what 
other people told me but I grew more and more skeptical the more I 
read I learned what it means to use reason 
 
As a student of chemistry I had to perform a qualitative analysis 
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab I hated experiments 
like this  they are oldfashioned and increase the students workload 
considerably Besides I had to do it twice since I failed in my first 
attempt However I think Ill never forget the lesson  
 
No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X 
it may still be Y It is very tempting to jump into conclusions take 
a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent  
But it can still be wrong  
 
I found out that I was after all using exactly the same mechanism 
to believe in god  mental selfassurance suspension of fear  
filtering of information In other words it was only me no god 
playing any part  
 
> The life  death and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact 
 
Oh And I had better believe this Dan many UFO stories are much better 
documented than the resurrection of Jesus The resurrection is documented 
quite haphazardly in the Bible  it seems the authors did not pay too 
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out Besides the ends of 
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance 
the end of Mark 16920 is missing from many early texts says my Bible 
 
Jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood 
 
> As much 
> as anything else you learn  How do you choose what to believe and  
> what not to 
 
This is easy I believe that the world exists independent of my mind 
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I 
observe Nothing else need to be taken on faith I will go by the 
evidence  
 
It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not 
I assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence presented

A liar how do you know what my attitude was Try reading your Bible 
again  
 
I was willing to die for my faith Those who do are usually remembered 
as heroes at least among those who believe Dan do you think Im 
lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years It seems it is  
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not 
do so anymore But I cant go on lying to myself 
 
Blind trust is dangerous and I was just another blind led by the blind 
But if god really wants me shell know what to do Im willing I just 
dont know whether she exists  looking at the available evidence 
it looks like she doesnt
