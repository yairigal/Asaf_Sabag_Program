I BELIEVE THAT THE IDEA OF OBJECTIVE MORALITY IS ABSURD, BECASUSE ALL
THE EVIDENCE I'VE SEEN INDICATES THAT MORALITY AND MORAL SYSTEMS ARE
MAN MADE AND THUS SUBJECTIVE.

THIS IS NOT A SHOT AT CHRISTIANITY; I WOULD APPLY IT TO ANY OTHER PERSON
OR GROUP THAT ADVOCATES OBJECTIVE MORALITY, UNLESS SAID PERSON/GROUP
CAN PROVIDE SOME SORT OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM.

ACTUALLY, CHRISTIANS DO CLAIM AN ABSOLUTE MORALITY, BUT THAT IS ANOTHER
MATTER.

NO, NOT REALLY.
