BR>         THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST SCIENTISTS EXCLUDE THE
BR> POSSIBILITY OF THE         SUPERNATURAL IN THE QUESTION OF
BR> ORIGINS.  IS THIS IS A FAIR PREMISE?         I UTTERLY
BR> REJECT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SCIENCE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF   
BR>      TRUTH.

IT IS BETTER THAN THE CRAP THAT THE CREATIONISTS PUT OUT.  SO FAR ALL THEY
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE IS DISTORTIONS AND HALF-TRUTHS. (WHEN THEY ARE NOT
TAKING QUOTES OUT OF CONTEXT...)

BR>         SOME OF THESE SO-CALLED HUMAN-LIKE CREATURES WERE
BR> APES.  SOME WERE         HUMANS.  SOME WERE FANCIFULLY
BR> RECONSTRUCTED FROM FRAGMENTS. 

THE GENETIC CODE HAS SHOWN MORE ABOUT HOW MAN IS REALTED TO PRIMATES THAT THE
FOSSIL RECORD.  (A LITTLE DETAIL THE CREATIONISTS TRY AND IGNORE.)

BR>            GOOD DEEDS DO NOT JUSTIFY A PERSON IN GOD'S
BR> SIGHT.            AN ATONEMENT (JESUS) IS NEEDED TO ATONE
BR> FOR SIN.

WHO SAYS?  YOUR BIBLE(TM)?	I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF *ANY* CHRISTIAN FOLLOWED
ALL OF THE RULES IN THE BIBLE.  (MOST OF THEM JUST PICK AND CHOOSE, ACCORDING
TO THE LOCAL BIASES.)

BR>      MY POINT: GOD IS THE CREATOR.  LOOK'S LIKE WE AGREE.

WHERE IS YOUR PROOF?  HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS *YOUR* GOD?

BR>      I'LL SEND YOU SOME INFO VIA E-MAIL.
BR>      REGARDS, BILL.

WHY NOT POST THEM?	I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM MYSELF.

                   ALAN
