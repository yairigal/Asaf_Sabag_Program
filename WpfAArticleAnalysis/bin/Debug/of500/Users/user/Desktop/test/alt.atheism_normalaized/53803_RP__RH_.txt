On a similar note a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a 
chain bookstore  Several of his peers were amazing one woman in 
particular 
 
A customer asked her if they had The Autobiography of Benjamin 
Franklin  Whos it by was her first question  Then Is he 
still alive  Then Is it fiction or nonfiction  
 
Finally my friend intervened and showed the guy where it was 
  
It makes one wonder what the standards of employment are
