#(REST DELETED)

#THAT'S A FALLACY, AND IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT IS POINTED OUT.

IT'S NOT A FALLACY - NOTE THE IF.   IF A SUPERMAJORITY OF DISINTERESTED PEOPLE 
AGREE ON A FUNDAMANTAL VALUE (WE'RE NOT DOING ETHICS YET BENEDIKT), THEN WHAT 
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THOSE PEOPLE AGREEING ON A TRIVIAL
OBSERVATION?

#FOR ONE, YOU HAVE NEVER GIVEN A SET OF MORALS PEOPLE AGREE UPON. UNLIKE
#A FOOTBALL. FURTHER, YOU CONVENIENTLY IGNORE HERE THAT THERE ARE
#MANY WHO WOULD NOT AGREE ON TGHE MORALITY OF SOMETHING. THE ANALOGY
#DOES NOT HOLD.

I HAVE, HOWEVER, GIVEN AN EXAMPLE OF A VALUE PEOPLE AGREE ON, AND EXPLAINED
WHY.  PEOPLE WILL AGREE THAT THEIR FREEDOM IS VALUABLE.  I HAVE ALSO
STATED THAT SUCH A VALUE IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR DOING OBJECTIVE
ETHICS - THE IF ASSERTION ABOVE.  AND THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THERE
ISN'T A POINT IN TALKING ABOUT ETHICS IF THIS CAN'T BE AGREED.

#ONE CAN EXPECT SUFFICIENTLY MANY PEOPLE TO AGREE ON ITS BEING A FOOTBALL,
#WHILE YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THAT ONLY VANISHING NUMBER DISAGREES
#WITH A SET OF MORALS YOU HAVE TO GIVE.

I'M NOT DOING MORALS (ETHICS) IF WE CAN'T GET PAST VALUES.  AS I SAY,
THE ONLY COGENT OBJECTION TO MY 'FREEDOM' EXAMPLE IS THAT MAYBE PEOPLE
AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING WHEN THEY ANSWER THAT IT IS VALUABLE.
MAYBE NOT, AND I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS SOME, ESPECIALLY THE IMPLICATIONS
OF ITS BEING TRUE.

#FURTHER, THE ABOVE IS EVIDENCE, NOT PROOF. PROOF WOULD EVOLVE OUT OF TESTING
#YOUR THEORY OF ABSOLUTE MORALS AGAINST COMPETING THEORIES.

GARBAGE.  THAT'S NOT PROOF EITHER.

#THE ABOVE IS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU REITERATE WHILE YOU NEVER ANSWER
#THE OBJECTIONS. EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE A PREACHER.

NAME THAT FALLACY.
