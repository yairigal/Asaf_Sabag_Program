IN ARTICLE <PWW-150493204223@SPAC-AT1-59.RICE.EDU> PWW@SPACSUN.RICE.EDU (PETER WALKER) WRITES:
I WRITE:
#> *SOME* VALUES ARE OBJECTIVE.  TRUTH IS BETTER THAN FALSEHOOD, PEACE IS
#> BETTER THAN WAR, EDUCATION IS BETTER THAN IGNORANCE.  WE KNOW THESE THINGS,
#> IF WE KNOW ANYTHING.
#
#NOW, PROVE IT. WHAT, YOU CAN'T? FRANK, YOU'RE RELIGIOUS AFTER ALL!
#WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT I CAN OBSERVE PHENOMENA, CREATE A THEORY THAT
#EXPLAINS NEW PHENOMENA, OBSERVE THESE NEW PHENOMENA. 

PROVE THAT YOU CAN OBSERVE PHENOMENA, LORD.
