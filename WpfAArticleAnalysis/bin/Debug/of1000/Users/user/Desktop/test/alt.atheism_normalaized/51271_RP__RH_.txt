If youre talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well 
its obviously a risk one takes

Im not an objectivist so Im not particularly impressed with problems of 
conceptualization  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of 
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary 
experience  One can get some rough understanding but the language is from 
the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the 
perspective of whats being described rather inexact to be charitable 
 
An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is 
that the better descriptive language is not available 
 
>And in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish 
>that 
 
This word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you 
can show how reliability can be determined
