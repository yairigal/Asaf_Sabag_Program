Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland 
into a country that has a particular church written into its  
constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated 
by that Church I fail to see why the word past is appropriate

You dont have to hand us a bunch of doubletalk about what 
I was seemingly attacking   I *quoted* what I was attacking
