How does Husserl deal with the problem of recursion  If  
intentionality lies behind the actions of a DES chip then 
intentionality of *what* and what lies behind the phenomena  
in the world of this what   Is there a grounding stage in

or do we have an infinite series of worlds   If there is a 
grounding stage how do we know were not it
