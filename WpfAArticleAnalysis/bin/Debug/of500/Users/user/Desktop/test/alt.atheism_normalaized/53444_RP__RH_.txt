This is simply complete nonsense The basis for matters of fact is 
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion 
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge 
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

Opinions about raw facts as you call them are somewhat different 
than interpretations of those raw facts

That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to 
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to 
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good 
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

See above We cant seem to agree on whats better
