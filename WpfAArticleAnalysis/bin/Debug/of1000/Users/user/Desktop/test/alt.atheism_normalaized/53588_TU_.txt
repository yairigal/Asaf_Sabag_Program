>IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN WACO, I NEED TO GET SOMETHING OF MY CHEST.
 
>FAITH AND DOGMA ARE DANGEROUS.
 
AGREED.
 
>A PHILOSOPHER CANNOT BE A CHRISTIAN BECAUSE A PHILOSOPHER CAN CHANGE
>HIS MIND, WHEREAS A CHRISTIAN CANNOT, DUE TO THE NATURE OF FAITH AND
>DOGMA PRESENT IN ANY RELIGION.
 
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND, BUT QUITE A FEW PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS
AND PHILOSOPHERS ARE THEISTS.
 
>SURE, RELIGION HAS MANY GOOD QUALITIES.  IT ENCOURAGES BENEVOLENCE AND
>PHILANTHROPY.
 
BUT ALSO INTOLERANCE AND SUPERSTITION.  I'M NOT SURE THAT IN THE BALANCE
IT IS NOT DETRIMENTAL.
 
>WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF EVERYONE WERE A SECULAR HUMANIST?
 
SURE WOULD!

THIS IS PATENTLY ABSURD; BUT WHOEVER WISHES TO BECOME A PHILOSOPHER
