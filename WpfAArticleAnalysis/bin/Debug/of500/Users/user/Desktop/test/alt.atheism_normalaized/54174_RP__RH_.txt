Cute characterization Bill however there is no inconsistency between  
the two statements  Even if one believes that religion is primitive  
simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and childish one 
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of 
complexity to the explanation  The ideas themselves dont have to be 
complex before being excised by Occams Razor they only have to add  
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description

I think the nonessential part of an explanatory system is one that 
adds no predictive capability to the system
