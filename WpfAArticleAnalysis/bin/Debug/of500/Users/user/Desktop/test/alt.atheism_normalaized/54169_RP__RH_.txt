Bruce hits the main point simply  as Russell Turpin does in more detail 
in his response  *All* sources are in modern historiography to be used 
critically which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are 
subject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other HUMAN 
considerations as well as the physical background  The critical method 
applies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others 
most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves

But given the critical principle what evidence is there that we have 
ANYTHING at ALL from firsthand sources about Jesus  Pauls letters are 
indeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions  They are as 
a result the most historically solid books in the NT  Pauls claims and 
descriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be wie es eigent 
lich gewesen  but they are most definitely the comments of a participant 
In other words wed evaluate Pauls statements more or less as we would 
the testimony of a witness in court 
 
The gospels are another story altogether  Luke is most assuredly NOT a 
firsthand witness  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closer 
to the actual events  but this is a conventional claim in ancient books 
and Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in his 
books which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke  John 
has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved 
disciple who is NOT named  We are not bound to accept this claim for 
a long time some scholars rejected it outright but even if we do it 
makes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand  Neither Mark 
nor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand  Later much later Christian 
tradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaic 
protogospel and associates Mark with Peter
