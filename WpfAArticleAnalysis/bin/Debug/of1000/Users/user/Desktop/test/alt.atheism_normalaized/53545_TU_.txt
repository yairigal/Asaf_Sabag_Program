TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID IN AN EARLIER POST: EVOLUTION IS THEORY AND FACT.  IF YOU
ACCEPT THE FACTS, THEN THAT IS A DISPLAY OF REASON AND INTELLIGENCE AND MUCH
DIFFERENT FROM ANACHRONISTIC RELIGION.  IF YOU ASSESS THE THEORIES OF EVOLUTION
OBJECTIVELY, THEN THERE CAN BE 0% RELIGION INVOLVED AND EVOLUTION REMAINS
USEFUL IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE.

SIMPLY PUT, EVOLUTION/CREATION WHEN EACH IS LOOKED AT PROPERLY - THEORY/FACT
VS. ASSERTION/FICTION - IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF EXACTLY WHAT SEPARATES REASON
AND SCIENCE FROM NONSENSE.
