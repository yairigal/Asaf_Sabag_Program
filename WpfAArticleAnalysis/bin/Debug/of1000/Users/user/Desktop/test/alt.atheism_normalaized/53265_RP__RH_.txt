Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist but faith in 
what  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink 
Unicorn does not exist  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa 
Claus does not exist  If it does and it may for some people I suppose it 
certainly isnt as big a leap of faith to say that these things and god 
DO exist  I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of faith 
 
Besides not believing in a god means one doesnt have to deal with all 
of the extra baggage that comes with it  This leaves a person feeling 
wonderfully free especially after beaten over the head with it for years 
I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer 
for many people and for that reason I think its important  However 
trying to force a psychological fantasy I dont mean that in a bad way 
but thats what it really is on someone else who isnt interested is 
extremely rude  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my 
belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life making me a better 
person allowing me to live without guilt etc and then tried to get 
you to believe in Santa too just cuz he did so much for me  Youd call 
the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone
