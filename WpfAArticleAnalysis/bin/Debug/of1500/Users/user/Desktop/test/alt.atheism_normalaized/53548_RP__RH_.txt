Put like this I cant answer I was originally pointing out that your 
attitude seemed to be I dont know if it really was that chemists 
tend to ignore all kinds of effects your original posting stated that 
when doing chemistry it is common to ignore atomic interactions and 
I responded that this is exactly what chemists do 
 
> Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years 
 
Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge my now Ill get 
flamed for sure  But perhaps I am guilty of referring to  
true chemists tm which are nothing but my ideal and do not 
actually exist Chemistry is a very easy subject to treat poorly

No actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use 
modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the 
old models In synthetic organic chemistry which still comprises 
a large part of organic chemistry it is indeed common to ignore 
the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional 
groups but I think this too has changed with the advent of 
molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis Supramolecular  
interactions can be taken into account albeit with difficulty
