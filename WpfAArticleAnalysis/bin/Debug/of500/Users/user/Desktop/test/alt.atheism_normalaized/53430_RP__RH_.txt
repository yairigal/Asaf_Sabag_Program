Consider special relativity  It hasnt be proved nor has it been 
disproved  No one has a proof one way or the other but many people 
are interested in it 
  
Ive satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the 
existence of God one way or the other  The two possibilities 
are supernaturalism and naturalism  Of course no set of circumstances can 
be inconsistent with supernaturalism but similarly no set of circumstances 
can be inconsistent with naturalism  In naturalism any phenomenon that 
could be described as God is considered part of the natural world to 
be studied as any other natural phenomenon gravity for instance   
For example if a loud godlike voice vociferously announced I 
am God I exist and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity 
and if then gravity did indeed reverse a naturalist probably a scientist 
would say Boy we sure didnt understand gravity as well as we 
thought we did and that loud voice is something new  Perhaps we 
didnt understand thunder as well as we thought we did either

Im sure glad you dont know where I live since you dont seem 
to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices 
in your head and Gods voice
