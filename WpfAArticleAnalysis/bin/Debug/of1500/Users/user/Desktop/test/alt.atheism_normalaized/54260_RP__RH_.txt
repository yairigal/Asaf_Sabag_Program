MC> Theory of Creationism MY theistic view of the theory of 
MC> creationism there  are many others is stated in Genesis 
MC> 1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth 
 
And which order of Creation do you accept	The story of creation is one of the 
many places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself  The following is 
an example 
 
GEN 125  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle  
after  their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his 
kind and God saw that it was good 
GEN 126  And God said Let us make man in our image  after  our likeness  
and  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of 
the air and over the cattle and  over  all the  earth  and over every 
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 
 
GEN 218  And the LORD God said It is  not  good  that  the  man should be 
alone I will make him an help meet for him 
GEN 219  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the  
field  and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he 
would call them and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature that was 
the name thereof 
 
Even your Bible cannot agree on how things were created  Why should we 
believe in it
