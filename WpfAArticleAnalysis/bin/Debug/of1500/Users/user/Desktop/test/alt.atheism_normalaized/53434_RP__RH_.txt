 When the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers 
 act in a certain way and we observe that they dont we have a contradiction 
 Something defined contradictorily cannot exist That what the believe in does 
 not exist Secondly there are better explanations for why they believe than 
 the existence of the object of their belief 
   
   
 Have you read the FAQ already

I cant recall anyone claiming that God makes anyone act a particlar 
way I think that youre attempting to manufacture a contradiction 
God is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is 
the believers sense of duty A standard of conduct does exist but we 
are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever 
ways we find convenient but our response to Gods edicts can in no 
way be used to question Gods existence The behavior of believers is 
a completely separate question from that of Gods existence there is 
nothing contradictory here 
 
To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really 
asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar All you 
can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself 
is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course 
 
Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief 
than the object of belief may lead to a rats nest of unnecessary 
complexity I think I know what youre implying but Id like to see 
your version of this better alternative just the same
