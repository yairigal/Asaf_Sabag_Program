What is your degree in again  or should I say when  This is a 1960s 
view of abiogenesis  PLease read something modern like Carle Wooses 
On the Origins which he beats these warm little ponds into the ground 
 
Look at archeobacteria  they live in areas so hot you would melt   
                         
And believe it or not we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of 
new drugs therapies and knowledge

You mean your theory  Again arguing this point is like telling a child 
that the sky will not fall  If the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere 
 
>would be left handed   
> 
The P=1  They are left handed   Really this is not a big deal  There are 
many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial

Please Jack rad some modern biololgy  i do not mean books by creationists 
about modern biology  Pick up a text book and read  I think you 
would like Wooses On the Origins  He is an arogant man but his writting 
and research is brilliant
