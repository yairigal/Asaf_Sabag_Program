I think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics 
Recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient just ask 
any assembly programmer

The oftquoted line that says people should be guaranteed life liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights is a complete lie 
and deception as the very authors of that line were in the process of 
proving  Liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost  
almost always at the cost to another  Whos liberty is more inalienable 
Similarly for right of life  When one person must die if he is to save 
another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable   
That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty  
especially for serial killers  Whos life and liberty is more valuable 
the serial killer or the victim  According to that beautiful line 
those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be 
able to remove them  This includes government  Admittedly the serial 
killer has restricted some peoples life andor liberty but is not his 
own lifeliberty inviolate also  According to the declaration of independence 
it is 
 
>>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule  And I thought I had 
>>>defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will 
 
Oooh I like that  It means that killing an infant is not murder because 
it cannot
