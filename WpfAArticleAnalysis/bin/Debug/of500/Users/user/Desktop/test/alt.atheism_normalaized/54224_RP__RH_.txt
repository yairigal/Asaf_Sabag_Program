 How does that qualify 
 Indeed its almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance 
 Ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as 
 accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend 
 Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but 
 they dont meet the other criterions

The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have 
created to make religion appear absurd Rather than approach religion 
including Christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims 
as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then 
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they dont have What is 
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist

 should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting 
 it across  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesnt 
 make it any more credible to me 
 If the Bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason 
 to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged 
 gods alleged existance 
 
Again I am paraphrasing Christian doctrine which is very clear on this 
point your dispute is not with me
