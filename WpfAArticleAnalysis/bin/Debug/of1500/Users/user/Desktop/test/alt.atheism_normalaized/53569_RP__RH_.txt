   Although I agree that creation is nonsense I submit that you are making 
the same mistake that creationists commonly do  In this and previous posts 
I think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy you have 
consistently characterized sciencereligion as rationalismnonsense when 
in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options  Neither do the 
former for that matter 
 
   I wish that the semiexplicit linking of evolution to socalled rational 
atheism could be avoided it just gives the creationists fuel for their 
oftenrepeated incantation that evolution leads to atheism
