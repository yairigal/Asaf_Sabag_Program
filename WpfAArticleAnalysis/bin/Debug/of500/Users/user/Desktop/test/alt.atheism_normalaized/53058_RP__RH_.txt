 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism ie the  
 belief that you cant deny anything that you cant prove doesnt exist 
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are 
 conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have 
 to believe in all of them  According to the above poster we must believe 
 in objects or beings that havent been proved not to exist so why stop at 
 God   there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan 
 except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond 
 hair and they all live  on other planets so we cant see them  The  
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians 
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God

  There is a big difference here Stalin didnt say that he stood for a  
  particular moral position ie against murder and terrorism etc and 
  then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least 
  an honest killer  This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this 
  viewpoint  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because 
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the 
  russians that helped Stalin that werent atheists  dont they contradict 
  your point  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant 
  to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists 
  cant value life as much as theists which you didnt support
