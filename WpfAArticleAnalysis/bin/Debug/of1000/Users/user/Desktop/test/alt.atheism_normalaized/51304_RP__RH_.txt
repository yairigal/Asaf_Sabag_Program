New in this version  challenge 5 plus an addendum summarizing 
Charleys responses todate 
 
 
*** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage 
*** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently  
*** specious claims  Ill continue to repost periodically until 
*** he answers them publicly indicates that he wont answer them 
*** stops posting to altatheism the altatheism community tells 
*** me to stop or I get totally bored  I apologize for the  
*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but Im at a loss 
*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  
*** seeming intellectual dishonesty 
*** 
*** This is repost 3 
 
 
Charley 
 
I cant help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers 
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your 
previous posts  I submit that you dont answer them because you 
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and I once 
again challenge you to prove me wrong  To make the task as easy for 
you as possible Ill present concise restatements of some of the 
questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may 
address them one at a time for all to see 
 
Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period I 
will repost this article with suitable additions and deletions at 
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic  I will repeat 
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or 
you cease to post to this newsgroup 
 
I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these 
questions previously and your answer missed my notice  If you can be 
kind enough to repost or email such articles I will be only too 
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it 
from this list 
 
Now to the questions 
 
1 After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological 
patterns that you proposed then semiretracting that claim by stating 
that you werent referring to *all* atheists I asked you to name some 
atheists who you feel dont fit your patterns to show that you indeed 
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of  You failed 
to do so  Please do so now 
 
Question Can you name any aa posters who do not fit into your 
stereotype 
 
Here is the context for the question 
 
>>> This is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line 
>>> in assuming that it is 
>> 
>>YOU however deleted the text further along where I said that I didnt mean 
>>to imply that everybodys experience was along the same lines   
> 
>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications you do so 
>repeatedly   
> 
>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name 
>those atheists that youve come across who *do not* fit into the 
>patterns that you theorize 
 
 
2 You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and 
reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied 
that we have an alternative called revelation  I have repeatedly 
asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both 
experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses 
and reason  You failed to do so  Please do so now 
 
Question Can you explain what is revelation and how one can 
experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent 
reasoning 
 
Here is the context for the question 
 
>>Revelation is not reason and if we DO have revelation then 
>>reasoning is NOT all we have 
 
>First show me that revelation exists  Second if revelation is not 
>perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived  According 
>to my Websters revelation is an act of revealing or communicating 
>divine truth  Now tell me how such a thing can be revealed 
>communicated other than via the senses  Tell me how you can interpret 
>this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to 
>interpret what you are sensing  When I say there is no way for a 
>human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as 
>interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple 
>truth  If you have another mechanism of interface by all means 
>share it with us 
 
then later 
 
>>>You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is 
>>>our senses and our reason period 
>> 
>>Again this is indefensible   
> 
>No it is simple truth  I challenge you to show me otherwise 
 
then later 
 
>>Few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of 
>>redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is 
>>begs the question of whether some senses are better than others 
> 
>I allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier 
>for you  Now show me that mystical experiences exist  Remember 
>you arent allowed to go by testimony of others eg mystics since 
>you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable  you know tainted by 
>my own bias  Further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show 
>me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of 
>interpretation via that persons reasoning capabilities 
> 
>I challenge you to show me these things  If you cannot do so you 
>might as well give up the fight 
 
then later
