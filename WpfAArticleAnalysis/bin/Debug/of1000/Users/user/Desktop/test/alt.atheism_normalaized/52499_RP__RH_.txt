abstract is that it creates information from no information  This is 
considered invalid in information theory  Statement 1 indicates one has no 
information about God  but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information 
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God  This violates 
information entropy  information has been extracted from no information at 
no cost 
 
The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions  The 
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the 
Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption The 
argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests 
to believe in God  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal 
intended the argument to be viewed 
 
The biggest reason why Pascals wager is a failure is that if God is 
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as 
a wager  He will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all 
whether people believe in him 
 
 
 
Subject What is Occams Razor 
 
Typical posting 
 
People keep talking about Occams Razor  What is it 
 
Response 
 
William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occams  
Razor  In its original form it said Do not multiply entities  
unnecessarily  That is if you can explain something without supposing 
the existence of some entity then do so 
 
Nowadays when people refer to Occams Razor they generally express it  
more generally for example as Take the simplest solution 
 
The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  
for what we see around us 
 
1 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which 
came into being as a result of natural processes 
 
2 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and  
there is also a God who created the universe  Clearly this God must be  
of nonzero complexity 
 
Given that both explanations fit the facts Occams Razor might suggest  
that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one 
Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution 
 
3 There isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there   
We just imagine that there is 
 
This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people  
find unacceptable

I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion 
 
Response 
 
Preaching is not appreciated 
 
Feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that 
are on a conversion theme  Such postings do not belong on altatheism and 
will be rejected from altatheismmoderated try the newsgroup 
talkreligionmisc 
 
You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite 
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you 
 
Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy 
analogies or parables  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the 
basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell 
atheists that God exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it 
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before 
 
 
 
Subject Why I know that God exists 
 
Typical posting 
 
I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists 
 
Response 
 
Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship 
exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not 
exist  That evidence varies from person to person 
 
Furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many 
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things  that they have been 
abducted by UFOs visited by the ghost of Elvis and so on 
 
 
 
Subject Einstein and God does not play dice 
 
Typical posting 
 
Albert Einstein believed in God  Do you think youre cleverer than him 
 
Response 
 
Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice with the universe  
This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the 
Christian God  Used this way it is out of context it refers to Einsteins 
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory Furthermore 
Einsteins religious background was Jewish rather than Christian 
 
A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following 
I believe in Spinozas God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of 
what exists not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of 
human beings 
 
Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an 
objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random 
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer  He believed that 
QM was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for 
statistical interpretations  So far no such better theory has been found 
and much evidence suggests that it never will be 
 
A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science Philosophy and Religion A 
Symposium published by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion 
in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life Inc New York 1941  In 
it he says 
 
  The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events 
   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side 
   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature  For him 
   neither the rule of human nor
