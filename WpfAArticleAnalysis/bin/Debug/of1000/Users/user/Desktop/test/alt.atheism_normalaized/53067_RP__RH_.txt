This supports nothing I have no reason to believe that this is  
piece is anything other than another antiIslamic slander job 
I have no respect for titles only for real content I can look 
up this article if I want true But I can tell you BCCI was not 
an Islamic bank Seeing as Im spending my time responding to 
propaganda in responding to this little subthread I really 
dont feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the 
effect that the propaganda is false If someone wants to discuss 
the issue more seriously then Id be glad to have a real discussion 
providing references etc
