Ill yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way 
to discuss it  If youre interested in a change heres an idea 
 
If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do 
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality 
Pardon the extremism but couldnt I murder your brother and say that I was  
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didnt want 
anyone forcing their morality on me or I dont follow your morality
