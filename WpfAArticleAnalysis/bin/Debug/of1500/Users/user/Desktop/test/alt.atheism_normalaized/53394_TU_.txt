THERE ARE MANY INDICATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE HAD SADDAM
BEEN WANTING OR PLANNING ON GOING INTO SAUDI ARABIA.  THERE WERE
NONE.  THIS HAS BEEN OPENLY STATED BY EX-PENTAGON ANALYSTS.  PULL.

ACTUALLY, REPORTS FROM OTHER MID-EAST COUNTRIES SHOWED THAT HUSSEIN
WAS READY TO MAKE CONCESSIONS DUE TO THE SANCTIONS.  WE JUST DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO - WE WANTED TO CRUSH HIM, AS WELL AS BATTLE-TEST ALL THESE HIGH
TECH TOYS WE'VE BUILT OVER THE YEARS.

WE'RE ALSO HYPOCRITES OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE.  OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.  ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS OUR OIL.  OH,
AND THE EXCUSE, NOW THAT THE SOVIETS ARE GONE FROM THE BOARD, TO KEEP
A SIZABLE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE GULF REGION.  CARE TO MAKE BETS ABOUT
WHEN ALL OUR TROOPS WILL COME HOME?

BASICALLY, SADDAM WAS OK WITH US.  HE WAS A KILLER, WHO TORTURED HIS
OWN PEOPLE, USED GAS ON THEM, AND OTHER HORRORS - HE WAS A BRUTAL
DICTATOR, BUT HE WAS OUR BRUTAL DICTATOR.  ONCE HE SAID "FUCK YOU" TO
THE US, HE BECAME THE NEXT HITLER.  THE SAME FOR NORIEGA.  HE WAS A
BASTARD, BUT HE WAS OUR BASTARD...UNTIL HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND WENT
HIS OWN WAY.  THEN WE HAD TO GET RID OF HIM.
