Or you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor  If you take 
a look at Quantum Mechanics many objective observations can be made 
as well  However Physics is not objective  Bohr said the randomness 
of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself  Einstein said that  
nature is deterministic it is our method of observation that inserts the 
randomness  They were talking about the exact same results 
 
Depends on how you look at it I guess
