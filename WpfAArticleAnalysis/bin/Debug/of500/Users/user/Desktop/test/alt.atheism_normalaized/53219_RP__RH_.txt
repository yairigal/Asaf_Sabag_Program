Of course the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the 
GIPU almost 2000 years ago you know the 9 of them that were written on 
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed  Since I am 
a prophet of the GIPU I decree that you should post the whole list of 
nicknames for the frequent posters here
