So although you dont agree with the fatwa and apparently dont think 
Rushdie should be killed for his book yet you think he is not due 
sympathy for being being under this threat  Furthermore you base this 
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular 
wellknown story which  if true  might reflect poorly on the 
absolute truth of your religion  Yet this opinion is formed without 
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context 
accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this 
book contains and what the authors motivations are  And then you 
come forward and recommend another book which touches on presumably 
plays with religioushistorical material because you find its 
overall presentation neutral
