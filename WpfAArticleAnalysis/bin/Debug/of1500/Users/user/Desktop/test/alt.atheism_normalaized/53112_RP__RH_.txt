The FlatEarthers state that the Earth is flat is a fact I dont accept 
this I think its an unproven opinion and I think the RoundEarthers are 
right because they have better evidence than the FlatEarthers do 
 
Although I cant prove that a god doesnt exist the arguments used to 
support a gods existence are weak and often selfcontradictory and Im not 
going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a 
reason to believe in a god that I absolutely cant ignore 
 
A while ago I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken 
in which he proved some of the wildest things and on the last page he 
wrote something like Can you prove it isnt so I certainly cant but 
Im not going to believe him because he based his proof on some really 
questionable stuff such as old myths he called it circumstancial 
evidence   
 
So far atheism hasnt made me kill anyone and Im regarded as quite an 
agreeable fellow really
