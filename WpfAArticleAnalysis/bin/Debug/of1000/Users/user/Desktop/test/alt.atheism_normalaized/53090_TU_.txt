ANYONE WHO DIES FOR A "CAUSE" RUNS THE RISK OF DYING FOR A LIE.  AS FOR
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR, WELL, WE'VE HAD GRIFTERS AND
CHARLATANS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION.  IF DAVID COPPERFIELD HAD
BEEN THE MESSIAH, I BET HE COULD HAVE FOUND PLENTY OF BELIEVERS.  
JESUS WAS HARDLY THE FIRST TO CLAIM TO BE A FAITH HEALER, AND HE WASN'T THE
FIRST TO BE "WITNESSED."  WHAT SETS HIM APART?

RUBBISH.  NATIONS HAVE FOLLOWED CRAZIES, LIARS, PSYCHOPATHS, AND 
MEGALOMANIACS THROUGHOUT HISTORY.  HITLER, TOJO, MUSSOLINI, KHOMEINI,
QADAFFI, STALIN, PAPA DOC, AND NIXON COME TO MIND...ALL FROM THIS CENTURY.
KORESH IS A NON-ISSUE.

>REAL THING.  

TAKE A DISCRETE MATHEMATICS OR FORMAL LOGIC COURSE.  THERE ARE FLAWS IN YOUR
LOGIC EVERYWHERE.  AND AS I'M SURE OTHERS WILL TELL YOU, READ THE FAQ!

OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE BIBLE FIRST.  JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS
WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE DOES NOT MEAN IT IS TRUE, AND THE AGE OF THAT TOME PLUS
THE LACK OF EXTERNAL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE MAKES IT LESS CREDIBLE.  SO IF YOU
DO QUOTE FROM THE BIBLE IN THE FUTURE, TRY TO BACK UP THAT QUOTE WITH 
SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.  OTHERWISE, YOU WILL GET FLAMED MERCILESSLY.

JUST LIKE WEIGHT LIFTING OR GUITAR PLAYING, EH?  I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU 
DEFINE THE WORLD "TOTAL," BUT I WOULD IMAGINE A "TOTAL SACRAFICE [SP]
OF EVERYTHING FOR GOD'S SAKE" WOULD INVOLVE MORE THAN A TIME COMMITMENT.

YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT OUR TENDENCY TO "BOX EVERYTHING INTO TIME UNITS."
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW ONE SHOULD INVOLOVE GOD IN SPORTS AND (HEHEHE)
TELEVISION?
