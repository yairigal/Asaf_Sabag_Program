I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you although 
my preference would be to move the discussion to another 
newsgroup  I feel a philosophy 
or religion group would be more appropriate The topic is deeply 
embedded in the world view of Islam and the 
esoteric teachings of the Prophet SA Heresy does not enter 
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric 
religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical 
substance of mans being and nature 
 
A good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory 
books to Islam in general is Murtaza Mutahharis Fundamentals 
of Islamic Thought  God Man and the Universe  Mizan Press 
translated by R Campbell Truly a beautiful book A followup book 
if you can find a decent translation is Wilaya  The Station 
of the Master by the same author I think it also goes under the 
title of Master and Mastership  Its a very small book  really 
just a transcription of a lecture by the author 
The introduction to the beautiful Psalms of Islam  translated 
by William C Chittick available through Muhammadi Trust of 
Great Britain is also an excellent introduction to the subject We 
have these books in our University library  I imagine any well 
stocked University library will have them 
 
From your posts you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought You 
should seek to know Shiite thought through knowledgeable  
Shiite authors as well  at least that much respect is due before the 
charge of heresy is levelled 
 
As salaam alaikum
