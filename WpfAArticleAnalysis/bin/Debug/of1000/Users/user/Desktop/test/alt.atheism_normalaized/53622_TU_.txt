#>#(DELETION)
#>#
#>#>|THEISM IS CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM. I HAVE NEITHER SAID THAT ALL FANATISM
#>#>|IS CAUSED BY THEISM NOR THAT ALL THEISM LEADS TO FANATISM. THE POINT IS,
#>#>|THEISM INCREASES THE CHANCE OF BECOMING A FANATIC. ONE COULD OF COURSE
#>#>|ARGUE THAT WOULD BE FANATICS TEND TOWARDS THEISM (FOR EXAMPLE), BUT I JUST
#>#>|HAVE TO LOOOK AT THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN THEISM WAS THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY
#>#>|TO INVALIDATE THAT CONCLUSION THAT THAT IS THE BASIC MECHANISM BEHIND IT.
#>#>
#>#>IMO, THE INFLUENCE OF STALIN, OR FOR THAT MATTER, AYN RAND, INVALIDATES YOUR
#>#>ASSUMPTION THAT THEISM IS THE FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED.
#>#
#>#BOGUS. I JUST SAID THAT THEISM IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR FOR FANATISM.
#>#THE POINT IS THAT THEISM IS *A* FACTOR.
#>
#>THAT'S YOUR CLAIM; NOW BACK IT UP.  I CONSIDER YOUR ARGUMENT AS USEFUL
#>AS THE FOLLOWING:  BELIEF IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM.  THEREFORE
#>BELIEF IS *A* FACTOR IN FANATICISM.  TRUE, AND UTTERLY USELESS.  (NOTE, THIS
#>IS *ANY* BELIEF, NOT BELIEF IN GODS)
#>
# 
#TIRING TO SAY THE LEAST. I HAVE BACKED IT UP, READ THE FIRST STATEMENT.

I HAVE READ IT.  CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE IS ANY EVIDENCE OR POINT.

# 
#THE LATTER IS THE FALLACY OF THE WRONG ANALOGY. SAYING SOMEONE BELIEVES
#SOMETHING IS HARDLY AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERSON AT ALL. SAYING SOMEONE
#IS A THEIST HOLDS MUCH MORE INFORMATION. FURTHER, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN
#THEISTS AND FANATISM IS HIGHER THAN THAT BETWEEN BELIEF AT ALL AND FANATISM
#BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THEISTIC BELIEF.

TRUTH BY BLATANT ASSERTION.  EVIDENCE?
# 
# 
#>#>GULLIBILITY,
#>#>BLIND OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY, LACK OF SCEPTICISM, AND SO ON, ARE ALL MORE
#>#>RELIABLE INDICATORS.  AND THE REALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE - THE SOURCES OF
#>#>FANATICISM - ARE OFTEN NONE OF THESE THINGS.  THEY ARE CYNICAL MANIPULATORS
#>#>OF THE GULLIBLE, WHO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
#>#
#>#THAT'S A CLAIM YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT. PLEASE NOTE THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE
#>#FIELD OF THEISM, THE LEADERS BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY.
#>
#>IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, YOU'RE INCREDIBLY NAIVE.
#>
# 
#YOU, FRANK O'DWYER, ARE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD. I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY
#BASE OF DISCUSSION LEFT AFTER SUCH A STATEMENT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK
#YOU ARE IGNORANT OF HUMAN NATURE. EVEN WHEN ONE STARTS WITH SOMETHING ONE DOES
#NOT BELIEVE, ONE GETS EASILY FOOLED INTO ACTUALLY BELIEVING WHAT ONE SAYS.
# 
#TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, PROVE YOUR STATEMENT.

THE ONUS OF PROOF IS ON YOU, SUNSHINE.  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT
THEIST LEADERS BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY?  ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAY
ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER, OR SAY ONE THING CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ITS
OPPOSITE?  THE PRACTICE IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THEISM, BUT IT'S THERE
FOR ANYONE TO SEE.  IT'S ALMOST AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY.

JUST FOR INSTANCE, IF IT IS HARDER FOR A CAMEL TO PASS THRU' THE EYE
OF A NEEDLE, WHY IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SUCH A WEALTHY LAND-OWNER?  WHY
ARE THERE CHURCHES TO THE SQUARE INCH IN MY COUNTRY?
# 
#>#>NOW, *SOME*
#>#>BRANDS OF THEISM, AND MORE PRECISELY *SOME* THEISTS, DO TEND TO FANATICISM,
#>#>I GRANT YOU.  TO TAR ALL THEISTS WITH THIS BRUSH IS BIGOTRY, NOT A REASONED
#>#>ARGUMENT - AND IT READS TO ME LIKE A WARM-UP FOR CENSORSHIP AND RESTRICTION
#>#>OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  EVER READ ANIMAL FARM?
#>#>
#>#THAT'S A STRAW MAN. AND AS USUALLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ONE HAS TO
#>#REPEAT IT: READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE: NOT EVERY THEISM LEADS TO
#>#FANATISM, AND NOT ALL FANATISM IS CAUSED BY THEISM. THE POINT IS,
#>#THERE IS A CORRELATION, AND IT COMES FROM INNATE FEATURES OF THEISM.
#>
#>NO, SOME OF IT COMES FROM FEATURES WHICH *SOME* THEISM HAS IN COMMON
#>WITH *SOME* FANATICISM.    YOUR LAST STATEMENT SIMPLY ISN'T IMPLIED BY
#>WHAT YOU SAY BEFORE, BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO SNEAK IN "INNATE FEATURES
#>OF [ALL] THEISM".  THE WORD YOU'RE GROPING FOR IS "SOME".
#>
# 
#BOGUS AGAIN. NOT ALL THEISM AS IS IS FANATIC. HOWEVER, THE REST ALREADY
#GIVES BACKUP FOR THE STATEMENT ABOUT THE CORRELATION ABOUT FANATISM AND
#THEISM. AND FURTHER, THE SPECIALTY OF OTHER THEISTIC BELIEFS ALLOWS THEM
#TO SWITCH TO FANATISM EASILY. IT TAKES JUST A NIFTY IMPROVEMENT IN THE
#THEOLOGY.

TRUTH BY BLATANT ASSERTION.  
# 
# 
#>#GULLIBILITY, BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THEM.
#>
#>NO SHIT, SHERLOCK.  SO WHY NOT TALK ABOUT GULLIBILITY INSTEAD OF THEISM,
#>SINCE IT SEEMS A WHOLE LOT MORE RELEVANT TO THE CASE YOU HAVE, AS OPPOSED
#>TO THE CASE YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE?
#>
# 
#BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ABOUT THEISM THAT THE ATTRACTION TO GULLIBLE PEOPLE
#CAUSING THE CORRELATION. AND THE WHOLE DISCUSSION STARTED THAT WAY BY THE
#STATEMENT THAT THEISM IS MEANINGFULLY CORRELATED TO FANATISM, WHICH YOU
#CHALLENGED.

INDEED I DID.  AS I RECALL, I ASKED FOR EVIDENCE.  WHAT IS THE CORRELATION
OF WHICH YOU SPEAK?  
# 
# 
#>#AND TO SAY THAT I AM GOING TO FORBID RELIGION IS ANOTHER OF YOUR STRAW
#>#MEN. INTERESTING THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER.
#>
#>I SAID IT READS LIKE A WARM UP TO THAT.  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN IRRATIONAL
#>AND BOGUS TIRADE, AND HAS NO OTHER USE THAN CREATING A NICE THEM/US
#>SPLIT IN THE MINDS OF EXCITABLE PEOPLE SUCH AS ARE TO BE FOUND ON EITHER
#>SIDE OF CHURCH WALLS.
#>
# 
#BLAH BLAH BLAH. I AM QUITE WELL AWARE THAT GIVING EVERYONE THEIR RIGHTS
#PROTECTS ME BETTER FROM FANATICS THAN THE OTHER WAY ROUND.

OF COURSE, OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS FANATICS, NEVER ONESELF.  YOUR
WISH TO SLUR ALL THEISTS SEEMS PRETTY FANATICAL TO ME.
# 
#IT IS QUITE NICE TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY IMPLYING A CONNECTION BETWEEN
#THAT ARGUMENT AND THE RISE OF FANATISM. SO FAR, IT IS JUST ANOTHER OF YOUR
#ASSERTIONS.

SO?  YOU CAN DO IT.
