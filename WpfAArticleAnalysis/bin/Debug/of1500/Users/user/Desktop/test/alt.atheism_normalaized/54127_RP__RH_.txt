The R Us thing is trademarked  I dont know if Charles 
Lazarus is dead or alive but Id be careful because with 
a name like Lazarus he might rise again just to start a 
lawsuit

I knew an architect once who I swear was employed to design 
the signs for the Toys R Us and Kids R Us stores  The signs 
The things they stick over the store or up on a big pole so they 
can be seen from the highway  What a job  All those hours in 
school studying to be an architect so you can tell them to move 
the pole ten feet closer to the highway
