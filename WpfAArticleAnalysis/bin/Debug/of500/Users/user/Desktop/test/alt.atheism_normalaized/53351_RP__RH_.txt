The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational 
attitude  Once one has accepted the assumption that there is no gods 
and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their 
assumptions contradict your assumption then I would say theres a 
lack of consistency here 
 
Now I know youll get on me about faith  If the positive belief that God 
does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational 
people have problems with that logic 
 
But you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist  Sorry for the flamage
