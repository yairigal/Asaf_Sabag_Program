You have given that example It is not lenient End of argument 
  
And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either It 
rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system 
without checking if they suit the description 
  
And wasnt the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according 
to Islamic law

No I even believe what I dont like Can you give better answers than that 
Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims

A fact if memory serves And most will see the connection between the 
primitive machism in the Orient and in Islam

As usually you miss the point Aids is  neither spread only through sex 
nor necessarily spread by having sex Futher the point is a very important 
point the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS It is even 
stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex The 
consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids 
Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex 
is not controlled is completely counterfactual 
  
  
And since you have brought up the point is your god evil or not
