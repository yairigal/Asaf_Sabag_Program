NO, LOOK AGAIN. WHILE YOU NEVER *SAID* IT, THE IMPLICATION IS PRETTY CLEAR.
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN ONLY RESPOND TO YOUR WORDS, NOT YOUR TRUE MEANING. USENET

LOOK, I'M NOT SUPPORTING *ANY* DOGMATIC POSITION. I'D BE A FOOL TO SAY THAT
IN THE LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ATHEISTS, NO PEOPLE EXIST WHO WISH TO
PROSELYTIZE IN THE SAME FASHION AS RELIGION. HOW MANY HARD ATHEISTS DO YOU 
SEE POSTING HERE, ANYWAY? MAYBE I'MM JUST NOT LOOKING HARD ENOUGH...

> SECOND, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M DEFENDING ANY GIVEN RELIGION?  I'M MERELY

I NEVER MEANT TO DO SO, ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU MIGHT GET THAT IDEA.
I WAS MERELY USING THE 'BIBLE' EXAMPLE AS AN ALLEGORY TO ILLUSTRATE MY
