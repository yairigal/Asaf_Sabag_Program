Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be  I realize the 
offhand nature of the numbers I used  And I cant answer as to what 
an acceptable loss rate is  However  as I said in another post  I 
despise the idea of supporting criminals for life  Its the economics 
of the situation that concern me most  The money spent feeding clothing 
housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are 
unfit to live in society could go to a number of places  all of which 
I and probably others  would consider far more worthwhile and which 
would enrish the lives of all Americans  Give people jobs  give the 
homeless shelter  Any number of things
