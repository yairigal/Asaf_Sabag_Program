Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged 
more than once When I did it you said good question and did not 
address it 
 
Ive addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless 
to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with  
Eric Rescorla

You still repeat that point 
 
I do Curious since I believe that was the first time Ive ever made it 
Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability 
to understand you ask me the same question Ill give you the same 
answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true  I 
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is 
making the same points and Im pushed for time then I try to respond what I  
believe are the strongest formulations of those points  If that doesnt 
include your post tough this is USENET and life is tough all over

You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others You appear 
with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning 
again 
 
Ive only debated this issue twice in aa and occasionally in ta  The 
first was in response to Simon Clippingdales positive assertion that 
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals 
are relative  It doesnt   Now Simon has dropped out of the debate 
for some time I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored 
with the topic  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty  Do you  
 
>d I cant always understand what you say 
  
Neither cant I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other 
side means 
 
Usually one does  Usually youre clear but sometimes you arent  
and I ask you
