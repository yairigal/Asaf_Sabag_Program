Well Id say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder 
For instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain 
blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually 
performed the action isnt the murderer but I guess this is actually made 
clear in the below definition

What do you mean by reasonable

Yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition  But 
even though the series is recursively infinite I think the meaning can 
still be deduced

Okay lets look at this situation  suppose there is a longstanding 
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some 
travesty in the distant past  Each time a member of the one family 
kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified 
in killing a that member of the first family  Now lets suppose that this 
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times  Or if you dont 
like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family 
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing  That is there 
is a neverending loop of slayings based on some nonexistent travesty 
How do you resolve this 
 
Well they are all murders 
 
Now I suppose that this isnt totally applicable to your problem but 
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system 
 
And in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder 
cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity 
And a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved  So the 
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily 
a murderer  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently 
unreducable definition  See in a totally objective system where all the 
information is available such a nested definition isnt really a problem
