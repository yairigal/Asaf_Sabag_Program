Sounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something 
Kampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here but they really have 
little power to get anything done  Sometimes it seems like there 
are a lot of them because theyre generally more vocal than their 
opposition but there really arent that many Krusaders 
 
The liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it since 
all they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives 
the way they want to  so you dont hear from or about most of 
them  The biblebangers stand out because they want everyone to 
be forced to live according to biblebanger rules 
 
The Krusaders certainly dont run this place 
 
Id say weve got a rather average mix of people here 
much like the rest of the US  And just like everywhere else 
some factions are louder than others
