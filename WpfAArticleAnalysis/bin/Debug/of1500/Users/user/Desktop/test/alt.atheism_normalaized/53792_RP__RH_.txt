John E King kingctroncom posts a whopping one liner 
 
 * The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * 
 *  treated as a matter of faith  Francis Hitching                     * 
 
  I have a few points to make about the above posting 
 
    1 Science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either 
    real or alleged experts  Critical reasoning evidence and if possible 
    experimentation are necessary  Creationists frequently display a massive 
    confusion about this by merely quoting both nonexperts and experts alike 
    some of the latter quotes are in fact false and steadfastly refusing to 
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure  This strongly suggests 
    that a their claims completely lack any scientific merit and b they 
    are aware of this fatal deficiency  Of course you may not actually be a 
    creationist and this may not be your real intent 
 
    2 You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his 
    statement  Why is that  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the 
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology 
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context 
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate 
    scientists  Of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may 
    not be your real intent 
 
    3 Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of 
    evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one 
    line quote from an unidentified nobody  It is also important to note that 
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate 
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck 
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid  Creationists seem rather fond 
    of diving head first into this logical fallacy  Of course you may not 
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent 
 
    4 Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science an attack 
    on evolution either the fact or the theory really represents an attack on 
    science  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve B the 
    fact of evolution will not ever go away  Creationists lost the battle long 
    ago more than 100 years in fact but are simply too willfully ignorant and 
    irrational to acknowledge the fact  Of course you may not actually be a 
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant

 * Neither I nor Websters has ever heard of Francis Hitchings  Who is he * 
 
  I like Hitchings am not to be found in Websters B  Francis Hitchings 
is a scientifically illiterate creationist or perhaps he is just playing the 
part of one who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution The Neck of 
the Giraffe  In that publication he quotes a creationist Jean Sloat Morton 
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could 
not have formed by chance  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution 
the two are quite independent but also concluding with a non sequitur ie 
the conclusion does not follow pp 7071  Hitchings also misquotes Richard 
Lewontin in an effort to support creationism pp 84 
 
  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber 
in the Los Angeles Times and repeated in the Oregonian  The article was 
titled Giraffe sticks scientific neck out too far  Excerpts include  
 
  Francis Hitchings is not a biologist  He goes after Darwin like Mark 
  Antony after Brutus  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and 
  pseudoscience with the sinuosity of a snakeoil salesman  He suggests 
  a mystical organizing principle of life using the similarity of organs 
  in different creatures as evidence sic 
 
  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not 
against it  If John E King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldnt 
surprise me much  Its also interesting that King had nothing to add ie 
he only posted a quote
