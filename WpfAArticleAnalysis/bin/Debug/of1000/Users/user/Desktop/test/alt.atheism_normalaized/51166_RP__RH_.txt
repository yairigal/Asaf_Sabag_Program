 Actually cannibalism is quite widespread  My favorite examples are sand 
 sharks and mackerel sharks  The fetuses begin cannibalizing each other and 
 the one that is eventually born enters the sea with a full stomache  Would 
 you like some more gruesome examples 
 
Fair enough  Im pretty well aware of the examples used  and mine were very 
rapidly and thoughtlessly pulled out of thin air but the point Im making is 
that our noncannibalism doesnt imply any value over other animals 
 
Did something happen while I wasnt looking  When did Homo sapiens become 
noncannibalistic
