Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible excitable 
and easily led from some concrete cause   In that case we would also 
have to discuss if that concrete cause rather than atheism was the 
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour 
 
Im not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour  merely that 
it is not relevant to the definition of atheism which is lack of belief in  
gods
