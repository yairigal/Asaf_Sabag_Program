>  Truth is better than falsehood  
 
	So if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand 1942 and 
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew is it objectively better to 
tell the truth  I am holding a Jew  than a falsehood  No I am not 
holding a Jew 
 
	In this case let us assume that if you lie the SS trooper leaves 
never to bother you Either way nothing is ever done to you no prison  
trouble etc 
 
	Of course if you tell the truth then the Jew will be executed 
 
	Is it better to tell the truth or lie 
 
Good question my point was that a world with truth is better than a world 
with falsehood  A world in which it were possible to say yes I am 
holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit 
down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives  
you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems 
to be to lie  Thats because other values are involved such as life 
Now that IS just my opinion  dont confuse the claim objective morality 
exists with the claim I have a lock on morals 
 
NB sir I could have responded with according to you truth does 
not exist therefore it is impossible to tell it  What is true for 
you may not be true for me
