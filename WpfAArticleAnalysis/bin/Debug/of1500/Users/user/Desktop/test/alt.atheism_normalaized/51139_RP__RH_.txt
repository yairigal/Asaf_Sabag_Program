Computers are an excellent exampleof evolution without a creator 
We did not create computers  We did not create the sand that goes 
into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into 
processor board  We took these things and put them together in an 
interesting way Just like plants create oxygen using light through  
photosynthesis  Its a much bigger leap to talk about something that 
created everything from nothing  I find it unfathomable to resort 
to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists we 
simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings  if there even 
were beginnings at all  And thats ok with me  The present keeps me 
perfectly busy
