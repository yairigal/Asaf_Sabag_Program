  So in conclusion it can be shown that there is essentially no 
  logical argument which clearly differentiates a cult from a 
  religion  I challenge anyone to produce a distinction which 
  is clear and cant be easily knocked down   
 
 How about this one a religion is a cult which has stood the test 
 of time 
 
Just like history is written by the winners and not the losers 
From what Ive seen of religions a religion is just a cult that 
was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert its doctrine using 
political and military measures  Perhaps if Koresh withstood the 
onslaught for another couple of months he would have started  
attracting more converts due to his strength hence becoming a 
full religion and not just a cult
