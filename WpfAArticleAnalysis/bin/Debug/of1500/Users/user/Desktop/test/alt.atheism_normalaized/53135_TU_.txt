I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS WILLL HAVE UNLIMITED STORES OF UNFOUNDED
RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON NEWSGROUPS/MAILING LISTS LONGER THAN I
HAVE, SO YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SYMPATHY TOM.  I HAVE ONLY BEEN SEMI-REGULARLY
POSTING (IT IS TOUGHTO KEEP UP) SINCE THIS FEBRUARY, BUT I HAVE BEEN READING
AND FOLLOWING THE THREADS SINCE LAST AUGUST: MY SCHOOL'S NEWSREADER WAS DOWN
FOR MONTHS AND OUR INCOMPETENT COMPUTING SERVICES NEVER BOTHERED TO FIND A NEW
FEED SITE, SO IT WASN'T ACCEPTING OUTGOING POSTINGS.  I DON'T THINK ANYONE
KEEPS TRACK OF WHERE OTHER POSTERS GO: IT'S THAT OLD LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM
INTERNET FOR YOU AGAIN...


BEST REGARDS,
