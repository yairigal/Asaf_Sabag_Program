BILL CONNER (BIL@OKCFORUM.OSRHE.EDU) WROTE:

: IF THERE IS A GOD AS DESCRIBED BY THE CHRISTIANS (FOR INSTANCE), THEN
: HE HAS EXISTENCE APART FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF HUMANKIND; HIS
: EXISTENCE IS OUTSIDE OF OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE (REALITY).

THUS, GOD DOES NOT _REALLY_ EXIST. HOW TRUE. THIS CLAIM WOULD
LEND SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT TO THE NOTION THAT RELIGIONS ARE ACTUALLY
SEAMLESS VIRTUAL REALITIES.

DOES GOD EXIST OR NOT? TO US, THIS QUESTION IS A TRUE DICHOTOMY.

CAN GOD KNOW A REASON FOR HER EXISTENCE? IF SHE IS OMNISCIENT, THEN
SHE MUST KNOW THIS. THERE IS A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM WHETHER ANYTHING
CAN EXIST WITHOUT A TIME FRAME - FOR INSTANCE, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO
OBSERVE OUR UNIVERSE FROM 'OUTSIDE', IN THE NEVERNESS SURROUNDING
THIS UNIVERSE, IT WOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED. 

THUS, WE ARE FACED WITH A TRILEMMA:

1) GOD 'META-EXISTS', AND FROM THIS META-EXISTING PERSPECTIVE SHE
CREATED EXISTENCE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING. 

THIS IMPLIES THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS NOT ACTUALLY FORMED OF NOTHING, WHICH
IS PRECISELY WHAT MANY THEORIES OF COSMOGENESIS (LIZHI & SHUXIAN: 
CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE) SAY. THIS 'NOTHINGNESS' IS NOT EMPTY ENOUGH,
IT IS NOT THE TRANSCENDENTAL NOTHINGNESS WHERE THERE IS NO EXISTENCE,
UNTIL (THERE IS NO 'WHEN' YET, BUT NEVER MIND) GOD, THE SOURCE OF
ALL EXISTENCE, STARTED TO PLAY. I FAIL TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THESE TWO FORMS OF NOTHINGNESS, THOUGH. IF THERE ISN'T ONE, IT MIGHT
BE GOD IS NOT NECESSARY FOR CREATION.

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE LEVELS OF 'META-EXISTENCE' ARE NOT NECESSARILY
LIMITED TO GOD, THERE MIGHT BE A 'META-GOD' ON SOME OTHER LEVEL.

2) GOD EXISTS, AND HAS ALWAYS EXISTED (SHE HAS A TIMESCALE, WHICH
IS DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN). THIS SOUNDS SENSIBLE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT
TO CONCEIVE HOW SHE COULD KNOW WHY SHE EXISTS - A BEING WHICH
HAS ALWAYS EXISTED, AND IS INFINITELY CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF, CAN
REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME, AND PERHAPS KNOW HERSELF
COMPLETELY, BUT SHE CANNOT KNOW WHY SHE EXISTS, AND HOW SHE KNOWS
EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS. WOULD A KNOWLEDGE OF HOW A BEING WITH A 
PERSONALITY (A SUBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT) KNOWS EVERYTHING BE THIS
BEING'S KNOWLEDGE? A CONSCIOUS BEING CONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING IS
ACTUALLY A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS - IT MEANS THAT GOD IS ONLY
CONSCIOUS OF HERSELF, SINCE WE, AND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, ARE
ALREADY INCORPORATED IN HER MENTAL MODELS, THOROUGHLY MODELLED.
ACTUALLY, A CONSCIOUS BEING CONSCIOUS OF ONLY ITSELF IS NOT
CONSCIOUS AT ALL. 

3) GOD IS HERSELF THE EXISTENCE. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN ORWELLIAN
REDEFINITION OF THE WORD EXISTENCE. A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS
STATEMENT IS THAT GOD IS ACTUALLY _ALL_ EXISTENCE. I THINK THIS IS
ALSO CALLED A FORM OF PANTHEISM.

: IF THIS
: BEING DECLARES A THING TO BE SO, IT IS -NECESSARILY- SO SINCE HE HAS
: DEFINED HIMSELF AS OMNIPOTENT AND, IF HIS CLAIMS ARE TO BE BELIEVED,
: HE IS AT LEAST OMNIPOTENT RELATIVE TO US. GOD IS INTRINSICALLY
: SELF-DEFINED AND ALL REALITY IS WHATEVER HE SAYS IT IS - IN AN
: OBJECTIVE SENSE.
