                            FREEENERGY TECHNOLOGY 
                       by Robert E McElwaine Physicist 
           
               Ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a  
          heavierthanair machine could not possibly fly  It would  
          violate the laws of physics  All of the experts and  
          authorities said so  
           
               For example Simon Newcomb declared in 1901  The  
          demonstration that no possible combination of known  
          substances known forms of machinery and known forms of  
          force can be united in a practical machine by which man  
          shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer  
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any  
          physical fact to be  
           
               Fortunately a few SMART people such as the Wright  
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final  
          word  Now we take airplanes for granted except when they  
          crash  
           
               Today orthodox physicists and other scientists are  
          saying similar things against several kinds of Free Energy  
          Technologies using negative terms such as pseudoscience  
          and perpetual motion and citing socalled laws which  
          assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed 1st law  
          of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful  
          energy 2nd law of thermodynamics  The physicists do not  
          know how to do certain things so they ARROGANTLY declare  
          that those things cannot be done  Such PRINCIPLES OF  
          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern science and help to  
          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox  
          modern theories  
           
               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a  
          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe with 
          OUT burning any kind of fuel making them the PERFECT  
          SOLUTION to the worldwide energy crisis and its associated  
          pollution degradation and depletion of the environment  
           
               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy  
          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by  
          various forms of induction  UNLIKE solar or wind devices  
          they need little or no energy storage capacity because they  
          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed  Solar energy  
          has the DISadvantage that the sun is often blocked by  
          clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced
