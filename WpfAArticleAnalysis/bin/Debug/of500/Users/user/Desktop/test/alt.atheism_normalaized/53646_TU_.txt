#DEFINE RANT_MODE
DID ANYONE SAY THE WORLD EXISTED FOREVER, NEVER WAS CREATED, AND HAS AN
ENDLESS SUPPLY OF ENERGY?

ALSO, THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO DON'T THINK THAT THE SPON-
TANEOUS GENERATION OF LIFE FROM NON-LIFE IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EVENT, GIVEN
A BILLION YEARS OR SO FOR IT TO TAKE PLACE.
#UNDEF RANT_MODE

"IMAGINATIVE THINKING" PROBABLY ISN'T THE RIGHT THING TO ASK.  THE THING IS,
AS YOU NO DOUBT HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD, THAT GENESIS 1 DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
A SCIENTIFIC THEORY.  GIVEN A SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE
OR EARTH OR ANYTHING ELSE, WE CAN DECIDE WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE EXPECT TO BE
TRUE ABOUT TODAY'S UNIVERSE.  WHAT PREDICTIONS DOES GENESIS 1 MAKE ABOUT
TODAY'S UNIVERSE THAT DISAGREE WITH THE STANDARD "SCIENTIFIC" VERSION,
AND HOW CAN WE TEST THEM?

IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, KEEP IN MIND THAT, DESPITE THE CONSIDERABLE
LENGTH OF TIME T.O HAS EXISTED, NO ONE HAS YET SUCCEEDED.
