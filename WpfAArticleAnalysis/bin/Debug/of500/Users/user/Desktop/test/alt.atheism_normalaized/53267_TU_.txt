GET A GRIP, MAN.  THE STALIN EXAMPLE WAS BROUGHT UP NOT AS AN
INDICTMENT OF ATHEISM, BUT MERELY AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW PEOPLE WILL
KILL OTHERS UNDER ANY NAME THAT'S FIT FOR THE OCCASION.

SO HARD ATHEISM HAS NOTHING TO PROVE?  THEN HOW DOES IT JUSTIFY THAT
GOD DOES NOT EXIST?  I KNOW, THERE'S THE FAQ, ETC.  BUT GUESS WHAT -- IF
THOSE JUSTIFICATIONS WERE SO COMPELLING WHY AREN'T PEOPLE FLOCKING TO
_HARD_ ATHEISM?  THEY'RE NOT, AND THEY WON'T.  I FOR ONE WILL DISCOURAGE
PEOPLE FROM HARD ATHEISM BY POINTING OUT THOSE VERY SOURCES AS RELIABLE
STATEMENTS ON HARD ATHEISM.

SECOND, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M DEFENDING ANY GIVEN RELIGION?  I'M MERELY
RECOGNIZING HARD ATHEISM FOR WHAT IT IS, A FAITH.

AND YES, BY "WE" I AM REFERRING TO EVERY READER OF THE POST.  WHERE IS THE
EVIDENCE THAT THE POSTER STATED THAT HE RELIED UPON?
