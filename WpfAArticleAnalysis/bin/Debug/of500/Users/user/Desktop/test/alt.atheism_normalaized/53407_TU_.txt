   FRANCIS HITCHING IS THE AUTHOR OF, AMONG OTHER BOOKS,
_THE NECK OF THE GIRAFFE_." HE BELIEVES EVOLUTION IS
DIRECTED BY SOME SORT OF COSMIC FORCE, BUT DOES NOT LIKE
DARWINISM.  HE WROTE IN THIS BOOK [ _THE NECK OF THE
GIRAFFE_, TICKNOR & FIELDS, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, 1982,
P. 12 (P. 4, PAPERBACK)] THAT:

   FOR ALL ITS ACCEPTANCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD AS THE
   GREAT UNIFYING PRINCIPLE OF BIOLOGY, DARWINISM, AFTER
   A CENTURY AND A QUARTER, IS IN A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF
   TROUBLE.  EVOLUTION AND DARWINISM ARE OFTEN TAKEN TO
   MEAN THE SAME THING.  BUT THEY DON'T.  EVOLUTION OF
   LIFE OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME IS A FACT, IF WE
   ARE TO BELIEVE EVIDENCE GATHERED DURING THE LAST TWO
   CENTURIES FROM GEOLOGY, PALEONTOLOGY, MOLECULAR BIOL-
   OGY AND MANY OTHER SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES.  DESPITE
   THE MANY BELIEVERS IN DIVINE CREATION WHO DISPUTE THIS
   ..., THE PROBABILITY THAT EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED
   APPROACHES CERTAINTY IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS....  ON THE
   OTHER HAND DARWINISM (OR NEO-DARWINISM, ITS MODERN
   VERSION) IS A THEORY THAT SEEKS TO EXPLAIN EVOLUTION.
   IT HAS NOT, CONTRARY TO GENERAL BELIEF, AND DESPITE
   VERY GREAT EFFORTS, BEEN PROVED.

   RESEARCH ON HITCHING TURNED UP THE FOLLOWING: HITCHING IS
BASICALLY A SENSATIONAL TV SCRIPT WRITER AND HAS NO SCIEN-
TIFIC CREDENTIALS.  IN _THE NECK OF THE GIRAFFE_ HE CLAIMED
TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, BUT AN
INQUIRY TO THAT INSTITUTE SAID HE WAS NOT.  HE IMPLIED IN
THE "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" OF _THE NECK OF THE GIRAFFE_ THAT
PALEONTOLOGIST STEPHEN JAY GOULD HAD HELPED IN THE WRITING
OF THE BOOK, BUT UPON INQUIRY GOULD SAID HE DID NOT KNOW HIM
AND HAD NO INFORMATION ABOUT HIM.  HITCHING ALSO IMPLIED
THAT HIS BOOK HAD BEEN ENDORSED BY RICHARD DAWKINS, BUT UPON
INQUIRY DAWKINS STATED: "I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT FRANCIS
HITCHING.  IF YOU ARE UNCOVERING THE FACT THAT HE IS A CHAR-
LATAN, GOOD FOR YOU.  HIS BOOK, _THE NECK OF THE GIRAFFE,_
IS ONE OF THE SILLIEST AND MOST IGNORANT I HAVE READ FOR
YEARS."

   HITCHING BELIEVES IN THE PARANORMAL AND HAS WRITTEN ON
MAYAN PYRAMID ENERGY AND FOR SOME "IN SEARCH OF..." EPISODES
ON BBC TELEVISION.  THE REFERENCE WORK _CONTEMPORARY
AUTHORS,_ VOL. 103, PAGE 208, LISTS HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE
SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, THE BRITISH SOCIETY OF
DOWSERS
