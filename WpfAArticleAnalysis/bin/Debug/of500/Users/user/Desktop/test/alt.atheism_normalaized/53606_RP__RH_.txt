I think this should be illuminating to all Let me make a first 
suggestion When Arabic words especially technical ones become of use  
let us define them for those especially atheists to whom they may not be 
terribly familiar Please also note that though I did initially refer 
to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim  rejected  
by you since  of personal infallibility I withdraw this as a basis 
for such a statement I conditionally retain this reference in regard 
to Khomeinis advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the  
socalled Twelve Imams which is in clear conflict with the Quran  
in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example 
higher than that of the Muhammad in that the Quran shows that the 
Prophet was clearly fallible as well as it appears given your 
abstruse theological statment regarding the natures  of the Twelve 
Imams placing them in a different metaphysical category than the  
remainder of humanity with the possible exception of Muhammad  
something which verges on the sin of association
