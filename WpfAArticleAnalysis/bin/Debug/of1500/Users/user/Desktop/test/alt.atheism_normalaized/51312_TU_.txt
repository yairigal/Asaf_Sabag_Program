CHARLEY WINGATE (MANGOE@CS.UMD.EDU) WROTE:
: 
: >> PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.  HOW IS OMNIPOTENCE CONTRADICTORY?
: 
: >BY DEFINITION, ALL THAT CAN OCCUR IN THE UNIVERSE IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES
: >OF NATURE. THUS GOD CANNOT BREAK THEM. ANYTHING THAT GOD DOES MUST BE ALLOWED
: >IN THE RULES SOMEWHERE. THEREFORE, OMNIPOTENCE CANNOT EXIST! IT CONTRADICTS
: >THE RULES OF NATURE.
: 
: OBVIOUSLY, AN OMNIPOTENT GOD CAN CHANGE THE RULES.

WHEN YOU SAY, "BY DEFINITION", WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING DEFINED;
CERTAINLY NOT OMNIPOTENCE. YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING THAT THE "RULES OF
NATURE" ARE PRE-EXISTANT SOMEHOW, THAT THEY NOT ONLY DEFINE NATURE BUT
ACTUALLY CAUSE IT. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR
FURTHER THOUGHTS ON THE QUESTION.
