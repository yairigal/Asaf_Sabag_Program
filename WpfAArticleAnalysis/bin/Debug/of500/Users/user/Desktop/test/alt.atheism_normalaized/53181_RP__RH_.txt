If you were omniscient youd know who exactly did what and with what 
purpose in mind  Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be 
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance 
with the general goal

In an objective system there are known goals  Then actions are judged 
as either being compatible with these goals or not  Simple  The problem 
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ  That is 
the goals of each society are different 
 
Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one

But we can enslave the animals right  But just not kill them  Or 
are you a vegetarian for health reasons 
 
>So are you a vegetarian 
 
No  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant anyway 
 
>Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system 
 
Of course not  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of
