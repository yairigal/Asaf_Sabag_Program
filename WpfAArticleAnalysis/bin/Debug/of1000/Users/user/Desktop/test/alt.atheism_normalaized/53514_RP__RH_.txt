abstraction Only when you have done that 
can we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not 
 
There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality but 
then again there have been plenty of claims made by different folk over 
the centuries Claims without fact to back them up are ultimatly very 
hollow things 
 
So having said that I would ask you to begin by demonstrating that morality 
is other than just an abstraction Care to meet the challenge
