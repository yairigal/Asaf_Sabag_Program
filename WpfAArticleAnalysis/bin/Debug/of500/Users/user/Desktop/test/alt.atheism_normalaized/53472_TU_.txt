BILL, I THINK YOU HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT ATHEISM. LACK OF 
BELIEF IN GOD DOES NOT DIRECTLY IMPLY LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
TRANSCENDENTAL VALUES. I HOPE YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE FACT THAT 
FOR INSTANCE BUDDHISTS APPRECIATE ISSUES RELATED TO NON-EMPIRICAL
REASONING WITHOUT THE NEED TO AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE IN THEISM.

I THINK READING A COUPLE OF BOOKS RELATED TO BUDDHISM MIGHT 
REVISE AND FINE TUNE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF NON-CHRISTIAN SYSTEMS.

CHEERS,
KENT
