GREGG, YOU HAVEN'T PROVIDED EVEN A TITLE OF AN ARTICLE TO SUPPORT *YOUR*
CONTENTION.

YOU ALSO HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT *IS* AN ANTI-ISLAMIC SLANDER JOB, APART
FROM YOUR OWN PREJUDICES.

WHY, YES.  WHAT'S A MERE REPORT IN THE TIMES STATING THAT BCCI FOLLOWED
ISLAMIC BANKING RULES?  GREGG *KNOWS* ISLAM IS GOOD, AND HE *KNOWS* BCCI WERE
BAD, THEREFORE BCCI *CANNOT* HAVE BEEN ISLAMIC.  ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS
OBVIOUSLY SPREADING SLANDEROUS PROPAGANDA.

I SEE.  IF SOMEONE WANTS TO PROVIDE REFERENCES TO ARTICLES YOU AGREE WITH,
YOU WILL ALSO RESPOND WITH REFERENCES TO ARTICLES YOU AGREE WITH?  MMM, YES,
THAT WOULD BE A VERY INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING DEBATE.  DOUBTLESS THAT'S HOW
YOU SPEND YOUR TIME IN SOC.CULTURE.ISLAM.

I'VE GOT A SPECIAL PLACE FOR YOU IN MY...

...KILL FILE.  RIGHT NEXT TO BOBBY.  WANT TO JOIN HIM?

THE MORE YOU POST, THE MORE I BECOME CONVINCED THAT IT IS SIMPLY A WASTE OF
TIME TO TRY AND REASON WITH MOSLEMS.  IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE?
