DID YOU MISS MY POST ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE QUOTE FROM THE INDONESIAN
HANDBOOK AND FRED RICE'S COMMENTS ABOUT TEMPORARY MARRIAGES?  IF SO, 
I WILL BE GLAD TO REPOST THEM.  WILL YOU ACCEPT THAT IT JUST MAY BE 
A PRACTICE AMONG SOME MUSLIMS, IF I DO?  OR WILL YOU CONTINUE TO CLAIM
THAT WE ARE ALL LYING AND THAT IT IS "NOT PRACTISED AT ALL AMONGST MUSLIMS".

I DON'T THINK F. KARNER HAS TO TELL EVERYONE ANYTHING.  LEAST OF ALL THAT
HE IS LYING.

SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS PRACTICE, THERE IS VERY LITTLE
YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION EXCEPT TO ACCUSE EVERYONE OF LYING.
PERHAPS IT IS YOUR IGNORANCE WHICH IS SHOWING.  LEARN MORE ABOUT ISLAM.
LEARN MORE ABOUT MUSLIMS.  OPEN YOUR EYES.  MAYBE YOU WILL ALSO SEE SOME
OF THE THINGS THE ATHEISTS SEE.
