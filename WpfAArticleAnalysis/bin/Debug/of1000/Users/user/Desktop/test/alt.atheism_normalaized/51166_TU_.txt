}: ACTUALLY, CANNIBALISM IS QUITE WIDESPREAD.  MY FAVORITE EXAMPLES ARE SAND
}: SHARKS AND MACKEREL SHARKS.  THE FETUSES BEGIN CANNIBALIZING EACH OTHER, AND
}: THE ONE THAT IS EVENTUALLY BORN ENTERS THE SEA WITH A FULL STOMACHE.  WOULD
}: YOU LIKE SOME MORE GRUESOME EXAMPLES?
}
}FAIR ENOUGH - I'M PRETTY WELL AWARE OF THE EXAMPLES USED - AND MINE WERE VERY
}RAPIDLY AND THOUGHTLESSLY PULLED OUT OF THIN AIR, BUT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS
}THAT OUR NON-CANNIBALISM DOESN'T IMPLY ANY `VALUE' OVER OTHER ANIMALS.

DID SOMETHING HAPPEN WHILE I WASN'T LOOKING?  WHEN DID _HOMO SAPIENS_ BECOME
NON-CANNIBALISTIC?
