Yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize 
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think 
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their 
beliefs 
 
And actually I think that the government already does recognize that 
Christianity is the dominant religion in this country  I mean it is 
Dont you realizerecognize this 
 
This isnt to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of 
Christianity just that most people do

If you agree with me then what are we discussing

No but I hear quite a bit about Christmas and little if anything about 
Jesus  Wouldnt this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really 
associated to a high degree with him  Or are you saying that the 
association with Jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks 
about it but just never talks about it 
 
That is can *you* prove that most people *do* associate Christmas 
most importantly with Jesus 
 
>Anyways the point again is that there are people who do associate 
>Christmas with Jesus It doesnt matter if these people are a majority 
>or not 
 
I think the numbers *do* matter  It takes a majority or at least a 
majority of those in power to discriminate  Doesnt it
