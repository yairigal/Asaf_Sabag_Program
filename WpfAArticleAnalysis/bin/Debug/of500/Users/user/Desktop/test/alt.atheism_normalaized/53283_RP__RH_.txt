Wait a minute Doug  I know you are better informed than that  The US  
has never invaded Nicaragua as far as I know  We liberated Grenada  
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  
of a strategic air strip  Panama we invaded true twice this century   
Vietnam  We were invited in by the government of S Vietnam  I guess  
we invaded Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War eh  Mexico  We have  
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times once this century but there were no missiles  
for anyone to shoot over here at that time  Hawaii  We liberated it from  
Spain 
 
So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where 
we cross someones border you are right 5 out of 6  But normally 
invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation 
If some nation invades the US Virgin Islands would they be 
invading the Virgin Islands or the US  So from this point of 
view your score falls to 2 out of 6 Mexico Panama

No its someone who believes in peaceatallcosts  In other words 
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and 
Czechoslakia but Poland too if it could have averted the War  And one 
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews slavs and political  
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone 
 
Is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik you ask  Well it depends 
on what your values are  If you value life over liberty peace over 
freedom then I guess not  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you 
than life itself if youd rather die fighting for liberty than live 
under a tyrants heel then yes its bad to be a peacenik 
 
The problem with most peaceniks it they consider those of us who
