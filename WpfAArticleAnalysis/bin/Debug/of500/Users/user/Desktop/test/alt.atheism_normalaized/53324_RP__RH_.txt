I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have 
been referring to one problem with a highlyinterpreted tradition 
like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain 
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor 
exactly a face value interpretation

While the context of the time is important value judgments must 
ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some 
base standard relative stabilitysuccess of a society eg  This 
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people 
for instance according to the Bible the surrounding people were 
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits  We need to look 
rather at what those peoples were *really* like  For instance in 
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is 
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of 
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue  By the 
Bibles own terms idolatry is inherently evil but I see no evidence 
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time 
were particularly bad people relative to the people in the Bible

Sounds good but it presupposes teethrending neighbors which I see 
no support for  One can argue that postfacto assertion of inhumane 
neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesnt mean that 
the actual neighbors really were inhuman  More to the
