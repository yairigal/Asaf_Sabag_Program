 Sorry Bill I had to clear this up There may be good evolutionary 
arguments against homosexuality but these dont qualify

 Oh I guess all those social insects eg ants bees etc which 
have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on 
the way out huh

 I refer you to the bonobos a species of primate as closeley related to 
humans as chimpanzees that is very closely They have sex all the 
time homosexual as well as heterosexual When the group finds food they 
have sex Before the go to sleep at night they have sex After they 
escape from or fight off prdators they have sex Sex serves a very important 
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species A species 
closely related to humans There is some indication that sex performs 
a social function in humans as well but even if not this shows that 
such a function is not *impossible*
