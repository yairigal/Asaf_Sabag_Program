Just a side note on this German translation or whatever of Josephus 
My historian friend says that the latest craze about Josephus is 
the Japanese translation  He says the thing is selling like hot cakes 
over in Japan  As good and powerful as Josephus reads in English I 
suspect it reads even better in Japanese
