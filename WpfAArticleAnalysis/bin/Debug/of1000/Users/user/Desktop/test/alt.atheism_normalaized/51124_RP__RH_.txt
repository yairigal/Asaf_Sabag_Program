It was no criticism of Islam for a change it was a criticism of the 
arguments used Namely whenever people you identify as Muslims are 
the victims of the attacks of others they are used an argument for 
the bad situation of Muslims But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize 
others are named they do not count as an argument because what these 
people did was not done as a true Muslims No mention is made how Muslims 
are the cause of a bad situation of another party
