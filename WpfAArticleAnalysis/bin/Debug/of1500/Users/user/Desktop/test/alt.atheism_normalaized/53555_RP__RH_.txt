Counterfeit atheists Hmmmm So were just cheap knockoffs of the 
True Atheists

Man what *is* your pill wrt atheists If youre going to make such 
contentious statements back them up At least READ NEWS timeandtime 
again weve hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold  
Try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like  
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist 
Then take a look at the responses weve given Tammy Seem pretty 
reasonable nay even polite to me

How lame can you get Who said anything about the truth of things 
Read the FAQ very carefully please Then report your findings about 
where it says the purpose of aa is to find the truth of things 
 
And stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us Its 
really pissing me off
