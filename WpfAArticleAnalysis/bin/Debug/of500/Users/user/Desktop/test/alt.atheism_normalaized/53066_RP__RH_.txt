 There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread 
 that are a little confusing An atheist is one for whom all things can 
 be understood as processes of nature  exclusively 
 
This definition does not include all atheists see the FAQ However 
I for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or 
spiritual explanations  
 
It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood 
as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not 
require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual 
for that matter Humans are not omnipotent and neither is science 
However science has one advantage theology doesnt it is self 
correcting with nature as its judge  
 
It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self 
consistent simple picture of our universe Science is no longer 
a bunch of separate branches it is one From particle physics to 
psychology And no aspect of our life or our universe is safe 
from its stern and stony eye Not even our consciousness 
 
 There is no need 
 for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything There is 
 no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by 
 physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is 
 determnined 
 
Actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question 
and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow 
superdeterministic or not I think the question does not have 
any meaning as far as individual human beings go If their apparent 
free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their 
perspective Bill can you say for sure whether you have a free 
will or not  
 
 This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all 
 its products There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it 
 acquire intelligence its just a happy accident 
 
Maybe Who are we to tell It seems intelligence is useful  when 
during the history of Earth has one species been able to control 
one third of the whole biosphere This can still be a result of  
numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates 
and preserves Even that machinery can be result of the same 
principle  only the systems that can start replicating will 
survive those which dont dont make it Recommended reading to 
 
 For an atheist no 
 event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less 
 value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about 
 an event
