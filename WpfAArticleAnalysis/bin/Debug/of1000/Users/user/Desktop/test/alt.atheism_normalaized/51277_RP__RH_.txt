Note that I never said that depression and the destruction of the 
nuclear family is due solely to extramarital sex  I specifically 
said that it was a prime cause of this not the prime cause or the 
only cause of this  I recognize that there are probably other factors 
too but I think that extramarital sex and subsequent destabilization 
of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in 
psychological problems including depression in the West in the 20th 
century
