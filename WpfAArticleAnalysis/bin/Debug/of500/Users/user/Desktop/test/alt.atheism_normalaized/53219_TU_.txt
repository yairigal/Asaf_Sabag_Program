OF COURSE, THE LIST HAS TO AGREE WITH THE NICKNAME LAWS LAID DOWN BY THE
GIPU ALMOST 2000 YEARS AGO (YOU KNOW... THE 9 OF THEM THAT WERE WRITTEN ON
THE IRON TABLETS THAT MELTED ONCE AND HAD TO BE REINSCRIBED?).  SINCE I AM
A PROPHET OF THE GIPU I DECREE THAT YOU SHOULD POST THE WHOLE LIST OF
NICKNAMES FOR THE FREQUENT POSTERS HERE!
