Size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a 
percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries 
too are all measures of size  In this case Id say the relevant 
statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to 
total casualties from among the total civilian population in the 
affected geographical area

Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons

Western news in general but in particular the American mass media 
CBS NBC ABC etc  The general tone of the news during the whole 
war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely 
this cruise missile blew this building to bits

Perhaps so  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too  But thats easy 
to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90s right  Back 
then it was *allout* war and Germany and Japan had to be squashed 
After all a million or more British had already died hundreds of  
thousands of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and  
millions of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and  
other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps  All  
things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were 
essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick 
end to avoid even greater allied losses 
 
I for one dont regret it

Sure  And its the people who suffer because of them  All the more 
reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their 
own selfish interests  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies 
as well

I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the 
West before the war  It is evident that the West especially America 
misjudged Hussein drastically  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  
threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds 
oil supply he had to be stopped  Sure the war could have been 
prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West 
before Hussein invaded Kuwait but it is still *Hussein* who is 
responsible for his decision to invade  And once he did so a 
strong response from the West was required

Well its not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up 
nearby countries and keep them  Or to allow them to continue with mass
