Thats fascinating  I take it that youre expressing skepticism 
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced 
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent  You 
could be right but it sounds plausible to me  Is there any 
reason that you dismiss it outofhand  Heres some more 
 
   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid1700s Indians were not 
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding 
   fathers but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy 
   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany 
   Plan of Union and later the Articles of Confederation and the 
   Constitution  That this would be absent from our school texts 
   and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion 
   Americans feel to our founding myth Great men gathered to express 
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time  If it were 
   revealed that Indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the 
   American psyche 
    
      By 1754 when most of these men and others gathered to creat the 
   Albany Plan of Union the first try at confederation they invited 
   fortytwo members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors 
   on confederate structures  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged 
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at 
   Albany Congress It would be a strange thingif six nations 
   of ignorant savagessic should be capable of forming such a union 
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted 
   for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should 
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies 
      According to Grinde Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs 
   and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he 
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy 
 
Grinde is Professor Donald GrindeJr of the University of California 
at Riverside whose book The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the 
American Nation addresses this issue
