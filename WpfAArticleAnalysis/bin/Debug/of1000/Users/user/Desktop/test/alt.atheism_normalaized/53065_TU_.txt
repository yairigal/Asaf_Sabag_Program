THANKS TO WHOEVER POSTED THIS WONDERFUL PARODY OF PEOPLE WHO POST WITHOUT 
READING THE FAQ!  I WAS LAUGHING FOR A GOOD 5 MINUTES.  WERE THERE ANY 
PARTS OF THE FAQ THAT WEREN'T MENTIONED?  I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE
OR TWO...

PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THIS WASN'T A JOKE.  I'M NOT READY TO HEAR THAT YET...
