This kind of argument cries for a comment

Do you have any evidence for this If the code was once perfect and 
has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour 
of this statement shouldnt we 
 
Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full 
of noncoding regions introns which are so called because they 
intervene with the coding regions exons An impressive amount of 
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is 
likely that early exons represented early protein domains 
 
Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing It appears that 
intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually 
have quite similar exonintron structure in their genes  
 
On the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted 
later presents several logical difficulties Introns are removed 
by a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unused 
if introns are inserted Moreover intron insertion would have 
required precise targeting  random insertion would not be tolerated 
since sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mRNA are 
conserved Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a 
trace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications and 
these are not found in or near intron sequences  
 
I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and 
genetics before posting theological arguments like this  
Try Watsons Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish 
 Baltimores Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters 
 
 Remember the question was posed in a theological context Why does 
 God cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a 
 theological perspective  my own  It is no less valid than a purely 
 scientific perspective just different 
 
Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas  
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion 
  
 I think you misread my meaning  I said God made the genetic code perfect 
 but that doesnt mean its perfect now  It has certainly evolved since 
 
For the worse Would you please cite a few references that support 
your assertion Your assertion is less valid than the scientific 
perspective unless you support
