Jim  we essentially agree except about the definition of fact 
The scientific definition of fact is not the ultimate truth but 
rather a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictive 
that it is pointless to test it anymore 
 
So we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution 
just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity and 
the fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory  The fact 
of evolution is that the current diversity of life arose through 
common descent  this is so supported by the evidence that no one ever 
bothers to try to test it anymore  Theories of evolution include 
theories regarding the mechanism of common descent natural selection 
vs drift or the actual pathways of evolution or any number of 
other things  These are constantly being tested because the actual 
mechanisms etc behind the fact of common descent are still up for 
question 
 
Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory  In other words it 
could theoretically still be falsified and rejected  But since its 
so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems 
pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction  You have 
shoehorned the facts of the existence of gravity and atoms and 
evolution into one category with the theories which have been 
proposed to explain the mechanisms  The existence of these things 
is so predictive as to be considered fact  The mechanisms on the 
other hand are still worth discussing
