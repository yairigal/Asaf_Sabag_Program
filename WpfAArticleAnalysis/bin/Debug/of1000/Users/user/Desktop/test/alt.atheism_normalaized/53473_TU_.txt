I CAN'T. IT SEEMS JESUS USED LOGIC TO MAKE PEOPLE USING LOGIC
LOOK LIKE FOOLS? NO, THAT DOES NOT SOUND RIGHT, HE MAYBE JUST
TOLD THEY WERE FOOLS, AND THAT'S IT, AND PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT...
HMM, DOES NOT SOUND REASONABLE EITHER...

I FIND IT ALWAYS VERY INTRIGUING TO SEE PEOPLE STATING THAT
TRANSCENDENTAL VALUES CAN'T BE EXPLAINED, AND THEN IN THE
NEXT SENTENCE THEY TRY TO EXPLAIN THESE UNEXPLAINED VALUES.
HIGHLY STRANGE.

CHEERS,
