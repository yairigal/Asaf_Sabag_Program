>>I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE DOING SO, BUT IT SEEMS YOU ARE IMPLYING

>>(2) THAT ISLAMIC TEACHINGS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH BLOWING UP THE WTC.

>>OKAY... TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS...

>>(1) THE PERSON HAS ONLY BEEN ACCUSED -- INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY,

>>AFTERWARDS, HE MUST BE INCREDIBLY STUPID.  

>PERHAPS SALAMEN WAS ONE OF THOSE "UNEDUCATED" MUSLIMS WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT.

>>NEVERTHELESS, HE WAS
>>APPARENTLY SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TOGETHER A VERY SOPHISTICATED BOMB.  IT
>>DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT TOGETHER, SOMEHOW.

>EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IN SCHOOL (BELIEVE IT OR NOT - WE ACTUALLY ALLOW RADICAL
>MUSLIM TYPES TO STUDY THINGS LIKE THIS IN OUR UNIVERSITIES - SO MUCH FOR
>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM)

FROM WHAT I READ, THE OTHER FELLOW TOLD SALAMEH HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER
OVER THE PHONE.  THE BOMB WAS SUPPOSEDLY SOME SORT OF SOPHISTICATED
TYPE, SO TO PUT A (I ASSUME COMPLICATED) SOPHISTICATED BOMB TOGETHER
FROM INSTRUCTIONS _OVER THE PHONE_ (!) ONE MUST NEED SOME BRAINS I WOULD
EXPECT.

>>DESPITE THIS, THERE HAVE
>>ALREADY BEEN MANY ATTACKS AND THREATS AGAINST MOSQUES AND MUSLIMS IN THE
>>UNITED STATES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS ACCUSATION, I HAVE READ.

>O.K., NOW PLEASE TELL US WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING.  I LIVE IN THE U.S. AND
>I HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE ABOUT THESE MOSQUE ATTACKS.  THERE ARE MANY MOSQUES
>IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON SO I CAN VERIFY
>THIS.  OR IS THE GREAT JEWISH MEDIA CONSPIRACY KEEPING US FROM KNOWING ABOUT
>THIS IN THE U.S.  WE HEARD ABOUT THE MOSQUE ATTACKS DURING THE DESERT STORM
>VENTURE, SO WHY IS IT SO QUIET NOW?  MAYBE IT IS LOCALIZED TO NEW JERSEY?

I READ THIS IN AN ARTICLE IN "THE AUSTRALIAN MUSLIM TIMES", THE
NEWSPAPER (WEEKLY) OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY.  

IF THIS IS TRUE, PERHAPS ONE OF THE MUSLIMS BASED IN NORTH AMERICA (IF
THEY SEE THIS POSTING) CAN ELABORATE.

>>(2) ISLAMIC TEACHINGS TEACH AGAINST HARMING THE INNOCENT.  IN THE QUR'AN
>>IT EXPLICITLY TEACHES AGAINST HARMING INNOCENTS EVEN IN TIMES OF WAR.
>>THE BLOWING UP OF THE WTC AND HARMING INNOCENTS IS THEREFORE IN BLATANT
>>CONTRADICTION TO ISLAMIC TEACHINGS.

>THIS MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  PLENTY OF PEOPLE COMMIT VIOLENCE WHILE 
>FOLLOWING WHAT THEY THINK ARE VALID
