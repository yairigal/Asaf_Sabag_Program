THOMAS M DISCH 
 
The Santa Claus Compromise 
Short story  The ultimate proof that Santa exists  All characters and  
events are fictitious  Any similarity to living or dead gods  uh well 
 
WALTER M MILLER JR 
 
A Canticle for Leibowitz 
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives 
copying blueprints from Saint Leibowitz filling the sheets of paper with 
ink and leaving white lines and letters 
 
EDGAR PANGBORN 
 
Davy 
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states  The church for example 
forbids that anyone produce describe or use any substance containing 
atoms  
 
PHILIP K DICK 
 
Philip K Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thoughtprovoking short  
stories and novels  His stories are bizarre at times but very approachable 
He wrote mainly SF but he wrote about people truth and religion rather than 
technology  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God he 
remained sceptical  Amongst his novels the following are of some relevance 
 
Galactic PotHealer 
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a 
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans  When the 
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pothealer Joe Fernwright is 
unable to comply  A polished ironic and amusing novel 
 
A Maze of Death 
Noteworthy for its description of a technologybased religion 
 
VALIS 
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic 
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of 
unknown but possibly divine origin  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and 
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters 
 
The Divine Invasion 
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from 
another star system  Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be 
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24hour easy listening music 
 
MARGARET ATWOOD 
 
The Handmaids Tale 
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously 
assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it 
right again  The book is the diary of a womans life as she tries to live 
under the new Christian theocracy  Womens right to own property is revoked 
and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed and the 
radio is only used for readings from the Bible  Crimes are punished 
retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are 
hunted down and hanged  Atwoods writing style is difficult to get used to 
at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on 
 
VARIOUS AUTHORS 
 
The Bible 
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized  However it 
is probably worth reading if only so that youll know what all the fuss is 
about  It exists in many different versions so make sure you get the one 
true version
