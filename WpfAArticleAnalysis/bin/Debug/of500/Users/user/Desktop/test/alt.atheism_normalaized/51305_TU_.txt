BUT, THE GOAL NEED NOT BE A SUBJECTIVE ONE.  FOR INSTANCE, THE GOAL OF
NATURAL MORALITY IS THE PROPOGATION OF A SPECIES, PERHAPS.  IT WASN'T
REALLY UNTIL THE MORE INTELLIGENT ANIMALS CAME ALONG THAT SOME REVISIONS
TO THIS WERE NECESSARY.  INTELLIGENT ANIMALS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS THAN
THE OTHERS, AND HENCE A MORALITY SUITED TO THEM MUST BE A BIT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN "THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE."  I DON'T THINK THAT
SELF-ACTUALIZATION IS SO SUBJECTIVE AS YOU MIGHT THINK.  AND, BY
OBJECTIVITY, I AM ASSUMING THAT THE IDEALS OF ANY SUCH SYSTEM COULD BE
CARRIED OUT COMPLETELY.
