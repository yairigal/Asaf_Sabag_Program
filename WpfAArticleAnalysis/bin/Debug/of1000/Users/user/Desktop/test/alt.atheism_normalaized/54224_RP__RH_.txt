 How does that qualify 
 Indeed its almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance 
 Ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as 
 accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend 
 Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but 
 they dont meet the other criterions

The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have 
created to make religion appear absurd Rather than approach religion 
including Christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims 
as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then 
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they dont have What is 
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist

 You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to 
 launch your own xtian mythology  This time meeting all the 
 requirements of myth 
  
Heres a good example of of what I said above Read the post again I 
said Acoording to  which means I am referring to Christian 
doctrine as I understand it if I am speaking for myself youll know 
it My purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of Christain 
doctrines since it seemed germane

 should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting 
 it across  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesnt 
 make it any more credible to me 
 If the Bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason 
 to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged 
 gods alleged existance 
 
Again I am paraphrasing Christian doctrine which is very clear on this 
point your dispute is not with me

 1 No they dont have to ignore the Bible  The Bible is far 
 from universally accepted  The Bible is NOT a proof of god 
 it is only a proof that some people have thought that there 
 was a god  Or does it prove even that  They might have been 
 writing it as series of fiction shortstories  As in the 
 case of Dionetics  Assuming the writers believed it the 
 only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it 
 And thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the 
 interpretations and Biblicalphilosophers were correct 
 
 2 There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible 
 
 3 Again read the FAQ 
 
1 Here again you miss the point The Bible itself is not the point 
its what it contains It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or 
even whos unaware of its existence Christians hold that it applies 
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate 
and the same innate knowledge of God 
 
2 See above 
 
3 If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ we wouldnt be 
having this conversation

 Bzztwrong answer 
 Gravity is directly THERE  It doesnt stop exerting a direct and 
 rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  God on the 
 other hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket except 
 on the tabloids  God doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence 
 Gravity is obvious gods arent 
 
As I said the evidence is there you just dont accept it here at 
least we agree

 No human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of 
 God it has usually come back to the existance of god 
 In other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtian 
 god it comes back to whether there is any god  And in much 
 of oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up as 
 the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces 
 are and which ones are out there  From a worldwide view 
 human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to 
 be andor what forces are currently in control  A natural 
 tendancy
