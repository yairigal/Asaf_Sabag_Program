An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules 
of Islam in regard to banking This is done explicitly by the 
bank This was not the case with BCCI

This is crap BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other 
international banks with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with 
outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments

Back to childish propaganda again You really ought to get a life 
rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing There are thousands 
of Islamic banks operating throughout the world which noone ever hears 
about If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about 
all the people whove been robbed by American banks
