In guncerenuxhaeasasuedu Selim Guncer  writes 
 
>You might not like what Bernard Lewis writes about label him 
>as a Zionist or such to discredit him etc  
 
You misrepresent me Selim  The hard evidence for my statements about 
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book 
Orientalism by Edward Said  Edward Said by the way is a Christian 
not a Muslim 
 
>I think he is 
>pretty much objective in his treatment in Race and Slavery in

>like the US prior to the civil war He also does not conceal

>of slaves What he doesnt and I dont think nobody can 
>deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be 
>abolished in Islamic countries Now you might rather conveniently 
>blame the practice of slavery on Muslims but the facts are out 
>there I also fail to see the relevance of the claim of Lewis being

Regarding Bernard Lewis 
 
Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his 
giving misrepresentations and halftruths about Islam 
 
Read Orientalism by Edward Said  see the evidence for yourself 
 
In fact I may post some of it here if it isnt too long 
 
>They were encyclopaedic information 
>which anybody can access  that slavery was abolished at certain 
>dates some 1200 years after Muhammed that this was the cause 
>of tensions in the Ottoman empire between the Arab slave traders 
>and the government etc We also have in the ASU library volumes 
>of British documents on slavery where reports and documents 
>concerning slavery all around the world can be found which I 
>checked some of the incidents Lewis mentions So I dont think 
>ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence 
 
I havent read Lewiss article so I cant comment directly upon it and 
have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his 
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam  His antiIslamic 
polemics as I understand it are often quite subtle and are often based 
on telling halftruths 
 
Again read Orientalism by Edward Said  I am not asking you to take 
what I say on trust in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get 
this book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for 
yourself 
 
>The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES 
>when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extramarital sex 
>I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines I wrote an 
>incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not 
>want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary 
>to the notion that sex is for procreation only In other 
>words such claims are baseless in the Quran and the Hadith 
 
If slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some 
Muslims opposed by Islam then using slaves for sexual 
purposes is necessarily opposed too 
 
>I seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you Islam is 
>not advocating slavery Slavery was an existing institution in the

>they assume the Quran is from a God and I think it is a rulebased 
>system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo 
>Slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women

>is a part of this system etc  
 
I understand your point of view Selim  I think rather it is us 
who are not getting through to you 
 
Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before 
 
Regarding women I have made posting after posting on this subject 
showing that Islam is not antiwoman etc  However have you been 
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them  I just reposted a 
very good one under the title Islam and Women reposted from 
socreligionislam  If this has already disappeared from your site 
then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this 
excellent article   
 
IMHO your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient 
 
Regarding slaves my posting on slavery  the second one I made 
which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year  is based 
completely on the Quran and contains numerous Quranic verses and 
hadiths to support its point of view 
 
Our approaches are different  you are arguing from a historical 
standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Quran 
and hadiths  Now just because people say they are Muslims and perform 
a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is 
part of Islam even if it is opposed by the Quran and Sunnah  No  Of 
course not 
 
Let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for 
you  The Quran prohibits drinking  Now if a person says I am a 
Muslim
