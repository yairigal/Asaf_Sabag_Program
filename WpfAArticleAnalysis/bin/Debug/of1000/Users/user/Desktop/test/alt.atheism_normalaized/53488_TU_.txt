AN "ISLAMIC BANK" IS SOMETHING WHICH OPERATES IN A DIFFERENT FASHION TO
YOUR MODERN BANK, AS I HAVE EXPLAINED HERE (ON ANOTHER THREAD) BEFORE.
FOR EXAMPLE, ISLAMIC BANKS DON'T PAY FIXED INTERESTS ON DEPOSITS, BUT A
RETURN ON INVESTMENTS (WHICH VARIES ACCORDING TO THE MARKET, AND IS NOT
FIXED LIKE INTEREST IS).

ISLAMIC BANKS ARE A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD.
THERE ARE NO ISLAMIC BANKS IN "THE WEST", INCLUDING THE USA, TO MY
KNOWLEDGE.  I DOUBT IF THE MARKET FOR THEM EXISTS THERE -- AT LEAST NOT
WHILE "ISLAMIC BANKS" ARE AT A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE OF THEIR
DEVELOPMENT AS IS THE CASE NOW.  BCCI IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT AN "ISLAMIC
BANK" -- DID BCCI EVER PAY A FIXED INTEREST RATE ON DEPOSITS?  IF THE
ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS "YES", THEN BCCI WAS NOT AN ISLAMIC BANK, AS
ISLAMIC BANKS ARE SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO _NOT_ PAY OR CHARGE INTEREST.

WHETHER SOME MUSLIMS PARTIALLY OWNED THE BANK OR WHATEVER IS COMPLETELY
IRRELEVANT.
