I THINK THAT DOMESTICATION WILL CHANGE BEHAVIOR TO A LARGE DEGREE.
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS EXHIBIT BEHAVIORS NOT FOUND IN THE WILD.  I
DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN BE VIEWED AS GOOD REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
WILD ANIMAL KINGDOM, SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN BRED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
TO PRODUCE CERTAIN BEHAVIORS, ETC.
