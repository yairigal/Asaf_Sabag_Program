Did anyone say the world existed forever never was created and has an 
endless supply of energy 
 
Also there are lots of people like myself who dont think that the spon 
taneous generation of life from nonlife is such an incredible event given 
a billion years or so for it to take place 
undef rantmode 
 
Imaginative thinking probably isnt the right thing to ask  The thing is 
as you no doubt have already been told that Genesis 1 does not constitute 
a scientific theory  Given a scientific theory of the origin of the universe 
or earth or anything else we can decide what sort of things we expect to be 
true about todays universe  What predictions does Genesis 1 make about 
todays universe that disagree with the standard scientific version 
and how can we test them 
 
If this is what you want to do keep in mind that despite the considerable 
length of time to has existed no one has yet succeeded
