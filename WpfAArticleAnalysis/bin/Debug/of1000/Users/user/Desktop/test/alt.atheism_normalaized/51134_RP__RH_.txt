  I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people 
  in prison for life 
 
  That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder but 
  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability 
  to commit the same crimes again 
 
  In other words if lifetime imprisonment doesnt work perhaps 
  its not because were not executing these people but because 
  were not being careful enough about how we lock them up
