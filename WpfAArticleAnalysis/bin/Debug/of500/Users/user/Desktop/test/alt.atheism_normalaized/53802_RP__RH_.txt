Whats your point

MAYBE TO ME In this example and as I argue below thats not even 
true 
 
>and so are its results 
Not necessarily

But science is also good for technology which may or may not 
have anything to do with truth I may value technology and 
not truth after all

Spare me This is nonsense Frank Pregnancy is sometimes referred 
to as having a bun in the oven Does this mean that the uterus 
is at 450 F Argument by idiom is weak indeed and its what 
youre engaging in here

Of course its different 3=ma What is at issue is accuracy 
not difference 
 
>Im making a decision as to the importance of F=ma

This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value 
of understanding the universe One can make the observation 
that IF one wanted to understand the universe F=ma would be 
valuable without believing F=ma to be valuable Frank
