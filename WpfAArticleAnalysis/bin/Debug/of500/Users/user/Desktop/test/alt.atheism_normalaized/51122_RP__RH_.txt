Take your foot out of your mouth I wondered about that already when I 
was a Catholic Christian The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable 
is one of the reasons why I am an atheist 
  
Believe me I believed similar sentences for a long time But that shows 
the power of religion and not anything about its claims

It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used Letting evil 
happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil 
is another evil

The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even 
before the omnipotent has created them There is no choice left All is known 
the course of events is fixed 
  
Not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by James Tims
