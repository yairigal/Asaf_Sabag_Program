As per various threads on science and creationism Ive started dabbling into a 
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland  A question 
that I had come from one of his comments  He stated that God is not  
necessarily a religious term but could be used as other scientific terms that 
give explanation for events or theories without being a proven scientific  
fact  I think I got his point  I can quote the section if Im being vague  
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates  Are there  
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of 
themselves or can everything be quantified measured tested etc
