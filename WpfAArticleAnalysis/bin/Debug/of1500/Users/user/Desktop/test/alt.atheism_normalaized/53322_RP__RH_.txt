Great start  I realize immediately that you are not interested 
in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me  I would 
much prefer an answer from Ms Healy who seems to have a 
reasonable and reasoned approach to things  Say arent you the 
creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about 
evolution some time ago

Duh gee then we must be talking Christian mythology now  I 
was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable logical 
person but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition 
of the same boring mythology Ive seen a thousand times before 
I am deleting the rest of your remarks unless I spot something 
that approaches an answer because they are merely a repetition 
of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought 
at all 
 
 
 
I have to congratulate you though Bill  You wouldnt 
know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls  Such 
a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated 
attempts to assist you in learning which I have seen 
in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent 
that goes well beyond my own meager abilities  I just dont 
seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences
