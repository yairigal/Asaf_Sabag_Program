No I think you are the one who is rather confused There are two senses 
in which we can say that the phenomenon of the working of the DES chip is  
valuebased 
 
	1 Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES 
	   chip and started it running in the first place 
 
		and 
 
	2 Because the very notiondefinitionconcept of works has value 
	   associated with it 
 
The first is a CAUSAL linkage  we want it to work therefore we CAUSE it to  
work That is rather a mundane interpretation The second however is a more  
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage  that the attribute works is  
itself as everything else presented to the human consciousness as a valued  
fact not just a factinitself You are perhaps justified in shooting down  
the causal linkage but you have not begun to address the phenomenological  
linkage

>values  
 
Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems 
are however items of value 
 
>Genetic algorithms closely related to the scientific method 
>can work without intervention of any kind  
 
Again our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms 
are items of value 
 
>Your claim is without merit 
>the universe does not depend on human values any more than it 
>revolves around earth 
 
The universe does not DEPEND on human values no but our experience and 
understanding and concepts of the universe are laced with human values 
Phenomenologically everything is valuerelated since the thing which is  
experiencing the phenomena ie self is itself valuedriven Self is in  
fact the very SOURCE of all values Whatever involves self involves values
