A WORLD CREATOR GOD DOES, THE MOMENT IT CREATES THE WORLD. AND TO SAYI
THAT YOU CAN'T RECALL *ANYONE* IS EVEN BELOW YOUR USUAL STANDARD OF
A"ARGUING".
 
MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON QUITE USUAL THEISTIC ASSUMPTIONS, NAMELY GOD
IS PERFECT, GOD IS ALL-KNOWING GOD SETS THE RULES. THE RULES DON'T
WORK FOR WHATEVER REASON. BECAUSE OF ITS OMNISCIENCE, THE GOD HAS
KNOWN IT. IN ADVANCE.

IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR, IT IS A QUESTION OF MODELLING. HAS BEEN
DISCUSSED IN THE WONDERFUL TIME WHEN YOU WERE NOT POSTING TO THIS GROUP.
WHEN A IS CONTRADICTORILY DEFINED A DOES NOT POINT TO AN INSTANCE IN
REALITY. UNLESS THERE IS MORE INFORMATION IN THE DEFINITION OF A THAT
ALLOWS ME TO FIND IT SOMEHOW. HOWEVER, WHEN THE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTE
IS SAID TO BE ESSENTIAL, IE HAS NOT GOT THAT ATTRIBUTE => NOT THE A I
AM LOOKING FOR, I CAN CONCLUDE THAT A DOES NOT EXIST.

THAT'S QUITE LIKE: I PREDICT COINS FALLING
   PREDICTED            HAPPENED
1.   HEADS                 TAILS
2.   TAILS                 TAILS
3.   HEADS                 TAILS
4.   HEADS                 TAILS
 
I TAKE 2. AND DISMISS THE REST BECAUSE OF THE UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY
THE OTHER EVIDENCE CAUSES.
