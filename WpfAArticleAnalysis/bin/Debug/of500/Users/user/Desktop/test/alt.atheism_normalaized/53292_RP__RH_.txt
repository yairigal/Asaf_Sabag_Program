Size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a 
percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries 
too are all measures of size  In this case Id say the relevant 
statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to 
total casualties from among the total civilian population in the 
affected geographical area

Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons

Western news in general but in particular the American mass media 
CBS NBC ABC etc  The general tone of the news during the whole

Perhaps so  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake
