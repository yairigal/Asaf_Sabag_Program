THIS IS SORT OF LIKE ASKING AN ATHEIST "WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVE THAT GOD
DOESN'T EXIST"?  DOUBTING SOMETHING DOES NOT IMPLY AFFIRMING THE CONTRARY.

FOR THAT MATTER, WHAT IF I DON'T ACCEPT THE CONCEPT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING AS
WELL-DEFINED AS "WESTERN POLICIES", BUT ONLY THAT THERE ARE POLICIES OF
INDIVIDUAL WESTERNERS WHICH DO NOT FORM A COHERENT COMBINED POLICY?
