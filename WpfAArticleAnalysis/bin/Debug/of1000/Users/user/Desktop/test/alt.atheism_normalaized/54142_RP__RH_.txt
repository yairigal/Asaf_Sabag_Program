I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are 
sufficiently sentient to have intentions   In fact I have explicitly 
said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are* 
capable of forming intentions 
 
What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive 
behaviour to have moral significance since it seems to me  
such behaviour does *not* involve intention

Thats not the point   The point is whether the implementor thinks 
*at all*    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A 
or opinion B but whether thinking takes place period

Since humans are part of nature are not all human actions natural 
 
Or perhaps youre going to throw in a definition of natural that 
will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as  
not natural   If so what is the definition

Sure they do as multiple posters have show you   Sharks for example 
eat wounded sharks   Ive personally seen cats eat their newborn 
 
Are you in some kind of denial   People give you example after example 
and you go off the air for a week and then pop up claiming that it  
never happened    Its very strange

See what I mean   Here we go again   What do we have to do write 
up a tailormade FAQ just for Mr Schneider
