"CORRECT" OVERSTATES THE CASE.  THE WHOLE POINT OF THE DISCUSSIONS
HAS BEEN THAT IT IS *REASONABLE* TO ASSUME THAT THERE WAS SOME BRIEF
REFERENCE TO JESUS THAT HAS BEEN DOCTORED.  BY CONSENSUS, THIS IS
THE *MOST* REASONABLE OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS -- BUT NOT SO MUCH
SO AS TO RULE OUT COMPLETE FABRICATION.
