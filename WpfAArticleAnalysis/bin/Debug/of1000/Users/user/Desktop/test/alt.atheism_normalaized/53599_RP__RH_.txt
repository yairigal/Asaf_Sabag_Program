Im afraid Im going to have to kill you  Dont worry though as a Loving 
Christian I guarantee that I will regret the fact that I have to kill 
you although I wont regret the actual killing

You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were 
maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW2 when it was far from clear 
that such bombing was necessary

No just the ones that have oil  Or the ones that look like they might make

I dont see that getting UN forces to East Timor is any harder than getting 
them to Iraq

Fine  Write to your Congressman and to President Clinton  Chinas status as 
Most Favoured Nation comes up for renewal in June  Point out that the US 
shouldnt be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime 
 
I doubt anything will happen  Clintons keener on trade sanctions against 
Europe

The same tired old misunderstanding  Moral relativism means that there is no 
*objective* standard of morality  It doesnt mean you cant judge other 
peoples morals  Christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer 
that into your head
