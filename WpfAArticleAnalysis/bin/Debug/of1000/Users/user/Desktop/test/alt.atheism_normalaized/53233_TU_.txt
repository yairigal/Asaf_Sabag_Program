I HAVE LEFT ALL THE ABOVE IN AS CONTEXT.

IT IS STRANGE THAT YOU MENTION JOSEPHUS, SINCE WELLS CLAIMS 
THAT HISTORIANS AND THEOLOGIANS WIDELY REGARD THE TWO MENTIONS IN JOSEPHUS TO BE 
CHRISTIAN INTERPOLATIONS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD OTHERS MAKE THIS CLAIM.

IN ADDITION, WELLS CLAIMS THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF DIS-HARMONY IN THE FOUR 
GOSPEL ACCOUNTS. ANY HARMONY THAT YOU FIND IS PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING, AS THERE 
SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE THAT MATTHEW AND LUKE ARE BASED ON MARK AND OTHER
DOCUMENTS.

WELL I RATHER THINK THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR HAND HERE :-)

I SUSPECT THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD HAS REPLACED 
MYTHOLOGY AND MYSTICISM AS METHOD OF FINDING OUT ABOUT THE WORLD. ONE MIGHT EVEN
CALL IT THE BEST SOURCE OF "TRUTH" WE HAVE AVAILABLE TODAY.

I WILL OFFER YOU A LITTLE DEAL.

I WILL READ THE NT, THE OT, AND THE TORAH (NT AND OT WILL BE NEB OR RSV 
VERSIONS) OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IF YOU WILL READ _DID_JESUS_EXIST_ AND STICK
TO IT PAST THE FIRST CHAPTER. THIS IS NOT SUCH AN ONEROUS TASK ON MY PART I WILL
ADMIT, AS I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO READ THE 3 I MENTIONED :-)

MAYBE WHEN YOU HAVE READ IT, YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.
