WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE MATH OF THE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE FRAMES OF REFERENCE
YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THIS "TIME" IS NOT PHYSICALLY RELEVANT...

        ^^^ "CENTER OF THE HOLE" WHERE THE EVIL SINGULARITY LURKS

THERE IS NO SINGULARITY AT THE HORIZON.  THE APPEARANCE THAT THERE IS ONE
COMES FROM ATTEMPTING TO USE A COORDINATE SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MAP PROPERLY
(PHYSICALLY) IN THIS GEOMETRY, RATHER ANALOGOUS TO THE "SINGULARITY" AT
THE NORTH AND SOUTH
