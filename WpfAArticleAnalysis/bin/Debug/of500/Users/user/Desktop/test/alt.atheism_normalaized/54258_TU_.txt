BR>        SINCE YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE MESSIAH, I ASSUME YOU
BR> ARE REFERRING         TO THE NEW TESTAMENT.  PLEASE DETAIL
BR> YOUR COMPLAINTS OR E-MAIL IF         YOU DON'T WANT TO POST.
BR>  FIRST-CENTURY GREEK IS WELL-KNOWN AND        
BR> WELL-UNDERSTOOD.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOSEPHUS, THE JEWISH
BR> HISTORIAN,         WHO ALSO WROTE OF JESUS?  IN ADDITION,
BR> THE FOUR GOSPEL ACCOUNTS		 ARE VERY MUCH IN HARMONY.

IT IS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE COMMENTS IN JOSEPHUS RELATING TO JESUS WERE
INSERTED (BADLY) BY LATER EDITORS.  AS FOR THE FOUR GOSPELS BEING IN HARMONY
ON THE ISSUE OF JESUS...  YOU KNOW NOT OF WHAT YOU SPEAK.  HERE ARE A FEW
CONTRADICTIONS STARTING WITH THE TRIAL AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE ASSENSION.

>THE DEATH OF JUDAS AFTER THE BETRAYAL OF JESUS

ACTS 1:18: "NOW THIS MAN (JUDAS) PURCHASED A FIELD WITH THE REWARD OF 
INIQUITY; AND FALLING HEADLONG, HE BURST ASUNDER IN THE MIDST, AND ALL HIS 
BOWELS GUSHED OUT."

MATT. 27:5-7: "AND HE (JUDAS) CAST DOWN THE PIECES OF SILVER IN THE TEMPLE, 
AND DEPARTED, AND WENT AND HANGED HIMSELF.  AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS...BOUGHT 
WITH THEM THE POTTER'S FIELD."

>WHAT WAS JESUS' PREDICTION REGARDING PETER'S DENIAL?

BEFORE THE COCK CROW - MATTHEW 26:34

BEFORE THE COCK CROW TWICE - MARK 14:30

>HOW MANY TIMES DID THE COCK CROW?

MAR 14:72  AND THE SECOND TIME THE COCK CREW. AND PETER CALLED TO MIND  THE 
WORD  THAT  JESUS  SAID UNTO HIM, BEFORE THE COCK CROW TWICE, THOU SHALT DENY
ME THRICE. AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEREON, HE WEPT.

MAT 26:74  THEN BEGAN HE TO CURSE AND TO SWEAR,  SAYING,  I  KNOW NOT THE MAN.
AND IMMEDIATELY THE COCK CREW.
MAT 26:75  AND PETER REMEMBERED THE WORD  OF  JESUS,  WHICH  SAID UNTO HIM,
BEFORE THE COCK CROW, THOU SHALT DENY ME THRICE. AND HE WENT OUT, AND WEPT
BITTERLY.

LUK 22:60  AND PETER SAID, MAN, I KNOW NOT WHAT THOU SAYEST.  AND IMMEDIATELY,
WHILE HE YET SPAKE, THE COCK CREW.
LUK 22:61  AND THE LORD TURNED, AND LOOKED UPON PETER. AND  PETER REMEMBERED
THE WORD OF THE LORD, HOW HE HAD SAID UNTO HIM, BEFORE THE COCK CROW, THOU
SHALT DENY ME THRICE.

JOH 13:38  JESUS ANSWERED HIM, WILT THOU LAY DOWN THY LIFE FOR MY SAKE? 
VERILY,
 VERILY, I SAY UNTO THEE, THE COCK SHALL NOT CROW, STILL THOU HAST DENIED ME
THRICE.

JOH 18:27  PETER THEN DENIED  AGAIN:  AND  IMMEDIATELY  THE  COCK CREW.

>DESTRUCTION OF CITIES (WHAT SAID WAS JEREMIAH WAS ZECHARIAH)

(THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE MATTHEW QUOTES A PROPHESY THAT WAS NEVER MADE! 
NOT THE ONLY TIME HE DOES THIS EITHER...)

MAT 27:9  THEN WAS FULFILLED THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN
