Kevin makes a good point here and when that theists miss alltoooften  That 
is the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreementlove of 
that diety so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond 
belief 
I guess the standard argumet goes something like well once you believe in 
God you know God is love and you will choose to love him if it wasnt so 
widely accepted and asserted itd be laughable
