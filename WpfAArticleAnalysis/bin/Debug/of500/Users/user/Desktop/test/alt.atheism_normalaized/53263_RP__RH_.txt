But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again 
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict 
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction  
repeatedly You cant repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that 
produced life So it seems we could never say Thats exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted 
it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability 
strictly speaking are lacking
