>  Truth is better than falsehood  
 
	So if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand 1942 and 
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew is it objectively better to 
tell the truth  I am holding a Jew  than a falsehood  No I am not 
holding a Jew 
 
	In this case let us assume that if you lie the SS trooper leaves 
never to bother you Either way nothing is ever done to you no prison  
trouble etc 
 
	Of course if you tell the truth then the Jew will be executed 
 
	Is it better to tell the truth or lie 
	 
 
 
 
 
	 In this case I would consider not saying anything to be a lie 
Or at the very least it implies that falsehood is on the same level of  
telling the truth Or we can stipulate that the SS have methods to make you  
say something only they can not control whether or not you say yes or 
no Only that you will say one or the other  
 
 
   Only when the Sun starts to orbit the Earth will I accept the Bible
