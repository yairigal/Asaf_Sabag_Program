GREAT START.  I REALIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED
IN DISCUSSION AND ARE GOING TO THUMP YOUR BABBLE AT ME.  I WOULD
MUCH PREFER AN ANSWER FROM MS HEALY, WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A
REASONABLE AND REASONED APPROACH TO THINGS.  SAY, AREN'T YOU THE
CREATIONIST GUY WHO MADE A LOT OF SILLY STATEMENTS ABOUT
EVOLUTION SOME TIME AGO?

DUH, GEE, THEN WE MUST BE TALKING CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY NOW.  I
WAS HOPING TO DISCUSS SOMETHING WITH A REASONABLE, LOGICAL
PERSON, BUT ALL YOU SEEM TO HAVE FOR YOUR SIDE IS A REPETITION
OF THE SAME BORING MYTHOLOGY I'VE SEEN A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE.
I AM DELETING THE REST OF YOUR REMARKS, UNLESS I SPOT SOMETHING
THAT APPROACHES AN ANSWER, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY A REPETITION
OF SOME UNINTERESTING DOCTRINE OR OTHER AND CONTAIN NO THOUGHT
AT ALL.

[..]

I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU, THOUGH, BILL.  YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW A LOGICAL ARGUMENT IF IT BIT YOU ON THE BALLS.  SUCH
A PERSISTENT LACK OF FUNCTION IN THE FACE OF REPEATED
ATTEMPTS TO ASSIST YOU IN LEARNING (WHICH I HAVE SEEN
IN THIS FORUM AND OTHERS IN THE PAST) SPEAKS OF A TALENT
THAT GOES WELL BEYOND MY OWN, MEAGER ABILITIES.  I JUST DON'T
SEEM TO HAVE THAT CAPACITY FOR IGNORING OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.
