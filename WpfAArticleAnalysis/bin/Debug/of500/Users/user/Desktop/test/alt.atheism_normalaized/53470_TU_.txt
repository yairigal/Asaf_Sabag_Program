YES, WHEN YOU TAG ON THE "UNFORTUNATELY, ...", THEN TO ALL INTENTS AND
PURPOSES YOU ARE SAYING THE SAME THING.

#WOULD YOU SAY THIS OF ANY TWO STATEMENTS, ONE SAYING "X IS MORAL" AND
#THE OTHER SAYING "X IS IMMORAL?"   HOW WOULD YOU DECIDED WHEN TWO 
#STATEMENTS "X IS MORAL" "X IS IMMORAL" ACTUALLY CONFLICT, AND WHEN
#THEY "SAY EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING".

WHAT THEY PRESCRIBE THAT ONE SHOULD DO IS A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR.

#THEY MIGHT LEAD YOU TO DO THE SAME THING, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT

#SAME THING.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.  YOU COULD FORMULATE A PRAGMATIC BELIEF IN MINIMUM 
FORCE AND STILL BE A PACIFIST.  IF THE MINIMUM IS 0, GREAT  - BUT ONE IS
ALWAYS TRYING TO GET AS CLOSE TO 0 FORCE AS POSSIBLE UNDER THAT BELIEF.
NOT THE SAME AS 'FORCE IS IMMORAL, PERIOD', BUT STILL TENDING TO PACIFISM.
