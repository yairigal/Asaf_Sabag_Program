I agree I reckon its television and the increase in fundamentalism You 
think its the increase in premarital sex others thinks its because 
psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent 
criminals con them into letting them out into the streets others think 
its the increase in designer drugs others think its a communist plot 
Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society 
are far too complicated for us to control We just have to hold on to the 
panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing But one 
things for sure depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not 
due solely to sex out of marriage
