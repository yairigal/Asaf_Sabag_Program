In article cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes 
Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source  This might be a  
literaryhistorical question but when I studied history I always looked for  
firsthand original sources to write my papers 
 
If I want to check the original New Testament manuscripts for possible copying 
errors or mistranslations which museum would I have to visit  If I wanted 
to do this for Alice in Wonderland Id visit the British Museum where I 
would find the original manuscript and be able to compare it to the printed 
edition that I own Id find many differences including a different title 
Likewise if I had a cast of Archaeopteryx I could take it to Berlin to 
compare it to the original fossil found at Solenhofen
