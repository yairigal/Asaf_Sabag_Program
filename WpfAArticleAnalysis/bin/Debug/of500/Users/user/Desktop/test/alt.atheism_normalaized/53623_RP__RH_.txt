If the Good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that 
they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism 
 
No and begging the question  see below 
 
>2 By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative terms 
  
Ditto here  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the 
part of the person making it 
 
Again incorrect and questionbegging  See below

Pretty perceptive that Prof Flew

Please explain how this helps  I dont see your argument 
 
I dont see yours  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything 
is either a subject or an object  Theres nothing compelling about that 
dichotomy  I might just as well divide the world into subjectobject 
event  It even seems more sensible  Causation for example is 
an event not a subject or an object   
 
Furthermore if subjectobject were true dichotomy ie 
 
	Everything is either a subject or an object 
 
Then is that statement a selfevident truth or not  If so then its  
all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly  
compelling  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved 
in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or  
solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate 
set of categories subject object event which can be reduced 
to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why 
yes I guess I *am* denying that selfevident truths are all in the mind of  
the beholder 
 
>>If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true 
 
All of it 
 
>If nothing then NO moral judgements are true
