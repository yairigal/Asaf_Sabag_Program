 Obviously an omnipotent god can change the rules 
 
When you say By definition what exactly is being defined 
certainly not omnipotence You seem to be saying that the rules of 
nature are preexistant somehow that they not only define nature but 
actually cause it If thats what you mean Id like to hear your 
further thoughts on the question
