BUT IT'S STILL HAPPENING.  THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT.  ONLY LAST MONTH, JOHN
MAJOR HAILED IT AS A GREAT VICTORY THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY SECURED A SALE OF
ARMS TO SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAME MONTH, WE SOLD JET FIGHTERS TO THE SAME
INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT THAT'S BUSY KILLING THE EAST TIMORESE.

IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY "OOPS, WE MADE A BOO-BOO, BETTER CLEAN UP THE
MISTAKE", BUT THE US AND UK *KEEP* MAKING THE *SAME* MISTAKE.  THEY DO IT SO
OFTEN THAT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT DELIBERATE.  THIS SUSPICION IS REINFORCED
BY THE FACT THAT THE MISTAKE IS AN EXTREMELY PROFITABLE ONE FOR A DECREPIT
ECONOMY RELIANT ON ARMS SALES.

NO, I THOUGHT BOTH WERE TERRIBLE.
