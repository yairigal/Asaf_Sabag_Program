*************************************************************************** 
	I just thought it necessary to help defend the point that Jesus  
existed  Guys Jesus existed  If he didnt then you have to say that  
Socrates didnt exist cuz he like Jesus has nothing from his hands that  
have survived  Only Plato and others record his existance  Many others  
record Jesus existance including the Babylonian Talmud  Sorry guys the  
argument that Jesus may not have existed is a dead point now  He did   
Whether he was God or whether there is a God is a completely different  
story however
