>>TO BORROW FROM PHILOSOPHY, YOU DON'T TRULY UNDERSTAND THE COLOR RED
>>UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN IT.
>NOT TRUE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE COLOR RED YOU STILL MIGHT
>HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF IT.

BUT, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT RED *WAS*, AND YOU CERTAINLY COULDN'T JUDGE
IT SUBJECTIVELY.  AND, OBJECTIVITY IS NOT APPLICABLE, SINCE YOU ARE WANTING
TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF RED.
