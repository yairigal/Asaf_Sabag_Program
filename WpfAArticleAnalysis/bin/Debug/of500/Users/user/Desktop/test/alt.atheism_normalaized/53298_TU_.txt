(WEBSTER:  MYTH:  "A TRADITIONAL OR LEGENDARY STORY...
           ...A BELIEF...WHOSE TRUTH IS ACCEPTED UNCRITICALLY.")

HOW DOES THAT QUALIFY?
INDEED, IT'S ALMOST OXYMORONIC...A RATHER AMUSING INSTANCE.
I'VE FOUND THAT MOST ATHEISTS HOLD ALMOST NO ATHEIST-VIEWS AS
"ACCEPTED UNCRITICALLY," ESPECIALLY THE FEW THAT ARE LEGEND.
MANY ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN BASIC TRUTHS, AS MYTHS DO, BUT
THEY DON'T MEET THE OTHER CRITERIONS.
ALSO...

YOU ACCUSE HIM OF REFERENCING MYTHOLOGY, THEN YOU PROCEDE TO
LAUNCH YOUR OWN XTIAN MYTHOLOGY.  (THIS TIME MEETING ALL THE
REQUIREMENTS OF MYTH.)

AH, BUT NOT EVERYONE "KNOWS" THAT GOD EXISTS.  SO YOU HAVE
A FALLACY.

AND THAT MAKES IT TRUE?  HOLDING WITH THE BIBLE RULES OUT CONTROVERSY?
READ THE FAQ.  IF YOU'VE READ IT, YOU MISSED SOMETHING, SO RE-READ.
(NOT A BAD SUGGESTION FOR ANYONE...I RE-READ IT JUST BEFORE THIS.)

...SHOULD I REPEAT WHAT I WROTE ABOVE FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING
IT ACROSS?  YOU MAY TRUST THE BIBLE, BUT YOUR TRUSTING IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT ANY MORE CREDIBLE TO ME.

IF THE BIBLE SAYS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS, THAT'S CLEARLY REASON
TO DOUBT THE BIBLE, BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE "KNOWS" YOUR ALLEGED
GOD'S ALLEGED EXISTANCE.

1) NO, THEY DON'T HAVE TO IGNORE THE BIBLE.  THE BIBLE IS FAR
FROM UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED.  THE BIBLE IS NOT A PROOF OF GOD;
IT IS ONLY A PROOF THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE
WAS A GOD.  (OR DOES IT PROVE EVEN THAT?  THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WRITING IT AS SERIES OF FICTION SHORT-STORIES.  AS IN THE
CASE OF DIONETICS.)  ASSUMING THE WRITERS BELIEVED IT, THE
ONLY THING IT COULD POSSIBLY
