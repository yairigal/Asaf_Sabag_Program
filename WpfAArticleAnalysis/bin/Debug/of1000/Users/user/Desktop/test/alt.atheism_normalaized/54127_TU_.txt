THE "R US" THING IS TRADEMARKED.  I DON'T KNOW IF CHARLES
LAZARUS IS DEAD OR ALIVE, BUT I'D BE CAREFUL, BECAUSE WITH
A NAME LIKE LAZARUS, HE MIGHT RISE AGAIN JUST TO START A
LAWSUIT.

(I KNEW AN ARCHITECT ONCE WHO, I SWEAR, WAS EMPLOYED TO DESIGN
THE SIGNS FOR THE TOYS R US AND KIDS R US STORES.  THE SIGNS.
THE THINGS THEY STICK OVER THE STORE OR UP ON A BIG POLE SO THEY
CAN BE SEEN FROM THE HIGHWAY.  WHAT A JOB.  ALL THOSE HOURS IN
SCHOOL STUDYING TO BE AN ARCHITECT SO YOU CAN TELL THEM TO MOVE
THE POLE TEN FEET CLOSER TO THE HIGHWAY.)
