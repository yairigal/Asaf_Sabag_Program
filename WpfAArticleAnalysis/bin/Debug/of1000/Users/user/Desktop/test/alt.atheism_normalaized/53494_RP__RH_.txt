Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an existence issue  It should be clear  
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only  
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim  The argument against the 
messiah claim is not weak maybe mine is but in the hands of pros it is not 
 
There are indeed two passages  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the 
messiah claim imo  Thats why I refered to the long which can be used  It  
flatly states Jesus was the Christ and mentions the crucifixion  
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims 
 
The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James brother   brother of 
Jesus who *was called* the Christ  emphasis mine and thats it  
If original Josephus has merely reported what some people say  It is nothing  
more than an observation one which lacks the Christian fundamentals 
 
The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons 1 its way out of 
context 2 Origen evidently knew nothing of it and 3 its rather inconsistent 
with the short  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as  
insert and I see Jim agrees  Consensus is usually reflected subtly as in 
Elaine Pagels Gnostic Gospels p 85 A comment *attributed* to Josephus 
reports emphasis mine  As for 2 I mentioned in my original post that  
the long is a 3rd century insert more properly postOrigen as Jim notes 
 
There may not be consensus on the short  The text which discusses James in a 
legal role stands with or without it  That it does not upset context makes it 
difficult to argue insert  On the other hand an inpassing insert is easily 
disguised in any context  Nonetheless on historiographical grounds it is  
worthless for the messiah defense and thats why I didnt mention it  
 
I dont know about the Arabic ms  If you have a translation reference Jim 
please let me know  As for its much less gungho tone obviously the date  
of this ms is critical  If after ca AD 700 a watereddown entry in lieu  
of removal can be easily explained
