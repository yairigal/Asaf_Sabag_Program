WELL, MAKE UP YOUR MIND.    IS IT TO BE "INSTINCTIVE NOT TO MURDER"
OR NOT?

IT'S NOT EVEN CORRECT.    ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES DO KILL
ONE ANOTHER.

SIGH.   I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE BEEN ROUND THIS LOOP.

I THINK THAT INSTINCTIVE BAHAVIOUR HAS NO MORAL SIGNIFICANCE.
I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BELIEVE THAT HIGHER ANIMALS, SUCH AS
PRIMATES, HAVE THE BEGINNINGS OF A MORAL SENSE, SINCE THEY SEEM
TO EXHIBIT SELF-AWARENESS.

SO WHAT?     ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT SOME KILLING IN ANIMALS
HAS A MORAL SIGNIFICANCE AND SOME DOES NOT?   IS THIS YOUR
NATURAL MORALITY>
