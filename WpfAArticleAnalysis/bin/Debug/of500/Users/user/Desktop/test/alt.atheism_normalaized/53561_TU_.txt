IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE DOZEN OR SO REFERENCES TO JESUS
OUTSIDE OF CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURE PROVIDE US *NO* EVIDENCE OF WHAT
HE TAUGHT OR WHAT HE DID BEYOND THE FACT THAT THE EARLY
CHRISTIANS CLAIMED HIM AS THEIR FOUNDER.  ALL OF THE WRITERS MUST
HAVE RECEIVED THEIR INFORMATION FROM THE EARLY CHRISTIANS,
PERHAPS SECOND OR THIRD HAND.  NONE OF THESE REFERENCES GIVE ANY
HINT THAT THE WRITERS HAD ANY INDEPENDENT INFORMATION ABOUT
JESUS. 

THESE REFERENCES DO SHOW THAT THE EARLY CHRISTIANS WERE HAVING AN
INFLUENCE, AT LEAST ENOUGH TO EARN A FEW LINES HERE AND THERE IN
OTHER PEOPLES' WRITINGS.  BUT THE TYPICAL USE TO WHICH THEY ARE
PUT BY SOME CHRISTIAN APOLOGISTS, IN MAKING PSUEDO-HISTORICAL
ARGUMENTS A LA JOSH, IS TOTALLY SPECIOUS.
