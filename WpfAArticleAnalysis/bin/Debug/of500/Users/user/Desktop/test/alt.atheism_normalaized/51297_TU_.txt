"TO PUT IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE: *I AM NOT A MUSLIM*.[...] I DO NOT
 ACCEPT THE CHARGE OF APOSTACY, BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER IN MY ADULT LIFE
 AFFIRMED ANY BELIEF, AND WHAT ONE HAS NOT AFFIRMED ONE CAN NOT BE
 SAID TO HAVE APOSTASIZED FROM.  THE ISLAM I KNOW STATES CLEARLY THAT
 'THERE CAN BE NO COERCION IN MATTERS OF RELIGION'.  THE MANY MUSLIMS
 I RESPECT WOULD BE HORRIFIED BY THE IDEA THAT THEY BELONG TO THEIR
 FAITH *PURELY BY VIRTUE OF BIRTH*, AND THAT A PERSON WHO FREELY CHOSE
 NOT TO BE A MUSLIM COULD THEREFORE BE PUT TO DEATH."

"GOD, SATAN, PARADISE, AND HELL ALL VANISHED ONE DAY IN MY FIFTEENTH
 YEAR, WHEN I QUITE ABRUPTLY LOST MY FAITH.  [...]AND AFTERWARDS, TO
 PROVE MY NEW-FOUND ATHEISM, I BOUGHT MYSELF A RATHER TASTELESS HAM
 SANDWICH, AND SO PARTOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME OF THE FORBIDDEN FLESH OF
 THE SWINE.  NO THUNDERBOLT ARRIVED TO STRIKE ME DOWN. [...] FROM THAT
 DAY TO THIS I HAVE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A WHOLLY SECULAT PERSON."

ONLY A FUNCTIONAL ILLITERATE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONCEPTION OF THE
NATURE OF THE NOVEL COULD THINK SUCH A THING.  I'LL ACCEPT IT
(RELUCTANTLY) FROM MOBS IN PAKISTAN, BUT NOT FROM YOU.  WHAT IS
PRESENTED IN THE FICTIONAL DREAM OF A DEMENTED CHARACTER CANNOT BY THE
WILDEST STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BE CONSIDERED A REFLECTION ON THE
ACTUAL MOHAMMAD.  WHAT'S WORSE, THE
