NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I SAID THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE CAN DISCUSS
THE SUBJECTIVE MERITS OF RELIGION OBJECTIVELY.  THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS.
PEOPLE HERE HAVE SAID THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT RELIGION,
BUT THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY ISN'T TRUE.

>>BUT REALLY, ARE YOU THREATENED BY THE MOTTO, OR BY THE PEOPLE THAT USE IT?
>THE MOTTO IS A TOOL.  LET'S TRY TO TAKE AWAY THE TOOL.

BUT, GUNS AND AXES ARE TOOLS, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN USED FOR MURDER.
SHOULD BOTH BE TAKEN AWAY?  THAT IS TO SAY, I DON'T THINK MOTTO MISUSE
WARRANTS ITS REMOVAL.  AT LEAST NOT IN THIS CASE.
