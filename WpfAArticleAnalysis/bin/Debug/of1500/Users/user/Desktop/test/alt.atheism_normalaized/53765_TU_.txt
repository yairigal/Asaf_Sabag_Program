>>THEY SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THE WORDING OF THE CONSTITUTION.  THEY
>>PICKED WORDS WHOSE MEANINGS IMPLIED THE INTENT.  WE HAVE ALREADY LOOKED

WELL, MOST HANGINGS ARE VERY QUICK AND, I IMAGINE, PAINLESS.

>FIRING SQUAD ? [ NOTE: NOT A CLEAN WAY TO DIE BACK IN THOSE 
>DAYS ], ETC. 
>ALL WOULD BE CONSIDERED CRUEL UNDER YOUR DEFINITION.
>ALL WERE ALLOWED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS.

AND, HANGINGS AND FIRING SQUADS ARE ALLOWED TODAY, TOO.  AND, IF THESE
THINGS WERE NOT CONSIDERED CRUEL, THEN SURELY A MEDICAL EXECUTION
(PAINLESS) WOULD NOT BE, EITHER.
