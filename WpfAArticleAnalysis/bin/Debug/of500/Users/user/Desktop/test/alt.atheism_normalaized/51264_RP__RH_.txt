Ahhhhh but that *is* the point   Honor should demand that each of them 
recognize that there is errorfaultmisunderstanding aplenty in the 
situation and to apologize to each other 
 
But since there is no honor *between* the two of them they hold to 
their own thickheaded paths refusing to recognize each other as human 
and dragging the family feud out into the future 
 
Honor is both an individual trait and a contract *between* two or more 
folk
