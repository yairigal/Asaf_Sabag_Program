#IN ARTICLE <1QV6AT$FB4@HORUS.AP.MCHP.SNI.DE>
#FRANK@D012S658.UUCP (FRANK O'DWYER) WRITES:
# 
#>#THE INFORMATION OF THAT IS INVARIANT UNDER YOUR CHILD BEING A SON OR
#>#A DAUGHTER AND SINGING ABOUT SANTA CLAUS. WASN'T YOUR ARGUMENT THAT
#>#"THERE HAS TO BE MORE"?
#>MORE THAN WHAT?
#MORE THAN WE ASSUME.

WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY?

#>(A) MOST OF THE PEOPLE I DEBATE DISAGREE WITH MY PREMISES.  HARDLY DEBATE
#>    OTHERWISE.
# 
#YOUR FAVORITE POINT THAT WE SENSE SO IT HS TO BE THERE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED
#MORE THAN ONCE. WHEN I DID IT, YOU SAID, "GOOD QUESTION", AND DID NOT
#ADDRESS IT.

I'VE ADDRESSED "IT" (YOUR CARICATURE IS NOT MY "FAVOURITE POINT", NEEDLESS
TO SAY) AT LENGTH IN A PREVIOUS OUTING, AND AM CURRENTLY DISCUSSING IT WITH 
ERIC RESCORLA.  

#>(B) THERE'S LITTLE POINT IN RESPONDING THE SAME POINTS EVERYWHERE; I DO
#>    MY BEST TO GIVE EVERYONE THE COURTESY OF A REPLY.
# 
#YOU STILL REPEAT THAT POINT.

I DO? CURIOUS, SINCE I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER MADE IT.
NOT THAT REPETITION WOULD IMPLY MUCH MORE THAN YOUR SEEMING INABILITY
TO UNDERSTAND; YOU ASK ME THE SAME QUESTION, I'LL GIVE YOU THE SAME
ANSWER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THIS CASE, I KNOW THE ANSWER TO BE TRUE.  I
DO MY BEST TO GIVE EVERYONE THE COURTESY OF A REPLY, BUT IF EVERYONE IS
MAKING THE SAME POINTS, AND I'M PUSHED FOR TIME, THEN I TRY TO RESPOND WHAT I 
BELIEVE ARE THE STRONGEST FORMULATIONS OF THOSE POINTS.  IF THAT DOESN'T
INCLUDE YOUR POST, TOUGH; THIS IS USENET, AND LIFE IS TOUGH ALL OVER.

#>(C) SINCE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF RESPONSES THIS ISN'T ALWAYS FEASIBLE;  I
#>    DO MY BEST TO HONESTLY ANSWER QUESTIONS PUT TO ME.
# 
#YOU DROP OUT OF DEBATES WITH SOME POSTERS AND CONTINUE WITH OTHERS. YOU APPEAR
#WITH THE SAME ISSUE EVERY N MONTHS, AND START THE DICUSSION AT THE BEGINNING
#AGAIN.

I'VE ONLY DEBATED THIS ISSUE TWICE IN A.A, AND OCCASIONALLY IN T.A.  THE
FIRST WAS IN RESPONSE TO SIMON CLIPPINGDALE'S POSITIVE ASSERTION THAT
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT MORAL VALUES INEXORABLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MORALS
ARE RELATIVE.  IT DOESN'T.   NOW, SIMON HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE DEBATE
FOR SOME TIME; I TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT HE IS EITHER BUSY, OR BORED
WITH THE TOPIC.  I CERTAINLY DO NOT ACCUSE HIM OF DISHONESTY.  DO YOU? 

#>(D) I CAN'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY
# 
#NEITHER CAN'T I UNDERSTAND YOU ALL THE TIME. USUALLY, ONE ASKS WHAT THE OTHER
#SIDE MEANS.

USUALLY, ONE DOES.  USUALLY YOU'RE CLEAR, BUT SOMETIMES YOU AREN'T 
AND I ASK YOU WHAT YOU MEAN; OTHER TIMES YOU SEEM TO GET EXTREMELY UPTIGHT 
AND I FEEL THAT I'M DEBATING AGAINST LINE NOISE.  SOMETIMES I GET TIRED, AND 
SOMETIMES I HAVE OTHER THINGS I'D RATHER DO.  AGAIN, THIS IS USENET, AND
LIFE IS TOUGH ALL OVER.  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

#>(E) YOU'RE STARTING TO GET PERSONALLY INSULTING; I MAY NOT EVEN PUT
