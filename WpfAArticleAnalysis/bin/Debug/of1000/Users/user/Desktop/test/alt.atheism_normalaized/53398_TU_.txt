WELL I AGREE WITH YOU IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAVE NO "MORAL" RIGHT TO INFLICT
THESE RULES, BUT THERE IS ONE THING I MIGHT ADD: AT THE VERY LEAST, ALMOST
EVERYBODY WANTS TO AVOID PAIN, AND IF THAT MEANS SACRIFICING SOME STUFF FOR A
HERD MORALITY, THEN SO BE IT.

RIGHT, AND SINCE THEY GREW UP AND LEARNED AROUND US, THEY HAVE SOME IDEA OF OUR
RIGHT AND WRONG, WHICH I THINK MUST, IN PART, BE INCORPORATED.  VERY RARELY DO
YOU SEE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR FOR "PHILOSOPHICAL REASONS"
