NOT NECESSARILY. IT IS MUCH THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE EVE HYPOTHESIS. IF
ALL, OR MOST, OF THE COPIES THAT WERE AVAILABLE WHEN PRINTING BECAME
COMMON WERE DECENDED FROM THE SAME COPY, A CHANGE IN THAT COPY WOULD
PROPAGATE TO ALL MODERN COPIES, EVEN IF THERE WERE OTHER COPIES IN 
EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF THE CHANGE. VERY FEW LIBRARIES WOULD HAVE
DUPLICATES OF A NON-RELIGIOUS BOOK, SO THERE WOULD BE FEW OPPORTUNITIES
FOR ANYONE TO NOTICE THAT THERE WERE VARIATIONS. EVEN IF SOMEONE DID
NOTICE, THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO COPY THE VARIATION THAT CONFORMED
TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND IGNORE THE OTHERS.
