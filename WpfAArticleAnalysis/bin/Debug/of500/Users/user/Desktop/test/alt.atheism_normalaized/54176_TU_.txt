>BUT YOU, PROBABLY LIKE ME, SEEM TO BE A SOFT ATHEIST.  SORRY FOR THE FLAMAGE.

CAN WE GET BACK TO USING THE TERMS "STRONG ATHEIST" AND "WEAK ATHEIST"
RATHER THAN THIS "HARD ATHEIST" AND "SOFT ATHEIST".  I CAN IMAGINE 
FUTURE DISCUSSIONS WITH NEWBIES WHERE THERE IS CONFUSION BECAUSE OF THE
MULTIPLICATION OF DESCRIPTIONS.
