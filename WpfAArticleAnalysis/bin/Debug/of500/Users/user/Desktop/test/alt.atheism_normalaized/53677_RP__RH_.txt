Ah Excellent So why doesnt she appear to me Im a little weak in the 
blind faith department Besides she doesnt even really need to appear 
how about oh say a little tip  something like put your all on 3 in the 
730 at the Dog Races  perhaps in a dream or vision

Im afraid I dont know arabic I have only read translations I wouldnt 
know it if it were wellwritten Consistent though is one thing the Quran 
is not  And have *you* read it in arabic  Besides some of my best 
writing has been done under the influence of shall we say consciousness 
altering substances

Yes so How do we know they *werent* very good Again assuming that the 
Quran is beautfully written

Ok I retract this point Although I might still say that once he knew he 
should have done something about it

>I agree But is it really true that this is the case 
 
I havent interviewed all muslims about this I would really like it if this 
were false But I cant take it on your sayso  what are your sources

What other basis do we have to judge a system Especially when we cant get 
a consistent picture of what Islam really is Do I believe Khomeini Do I 
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey Or 
perhaps
