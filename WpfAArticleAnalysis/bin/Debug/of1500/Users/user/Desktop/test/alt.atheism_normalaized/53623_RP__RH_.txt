If the Good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that 
they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism 
 
No and begging the question  see below 
 
>2 By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative terms 
  
Ditto here  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the 
part of the person making it 
 
Again incorrect and questionbegging  See below

Pretty perceptive that Prof Flew

>Of course by denying that subjectobject is true dichotomy 
  
Please explain how this helps  I dont see your argument 
 
I dont see yours  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything 
is either a subject or an object  Theres nothing compelling about that 
dichotomy  I might just as well divide the world into subjectobject 
event  It even seems more sensible  Causation for example is 
an event not a subject or an object   
 
Furthermore if subjectobject were true dichotomy ie 
 
	Everything is either a subject or an object 
 
Then is that statement a selfevident truth or not  If so then its  
all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly  
compelling  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved 
in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or  
solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate 
set of categories subject object event which can be reduced 
to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why 
yes I guess I *am* denying that selfevident truths are all in the mind of  
the beholder 
 
>>If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true 
 
All of it

This makes no sense either  Flew is arguing that this is where the 
objectivist winds up not the subjectivist  Furthermore the nihilists 
believed in nothing *except* science materialism revolution and the 
People 
 
Im referring to ethical nihilism 
 
>>The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are 
>>some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself 
>>To hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be

>And if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion 
>is not true  Likewise if the preferences should include noTerrorism 
>that moral opinion is not true  Why should one choose a set of 
>preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes 
>noTerrorism  Oh no reason  This is patently absurd 
  
And also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out 
to you already by others  Ditch the strawman already and see my reply 
to Mike Cobbs root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality 
 
Ive responded over there  BTW  I dont intend this as a strawman but 
as something logically entailed by relativism really any ethical system 
where values are assumed to be unreal  Its different to say Relativists 
say than relativism implies
