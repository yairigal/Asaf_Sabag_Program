HOW DOES HUSSERL DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF RECURSION?  IF 
INTENTIONALITY LIES BEHIND THE ACTIONS OF A DES CHIP, THEN
INTENTIONALITY OF *WHAT*, AND WHAT LIES BEHIND THE PHENOMENA 
IN THE WORLD OF THIS "WHAT"?   IS THERE A GROUNDING STAGE IN
A WORLD OF PURE PHENOMENA WITH NO INTENTIONALITY BEHIND THEM, 
OR DO WE HAVE AN INFINITE SERIES OF WORLDS?   IF THERE IS A
GROUNDING STAGE, HOW DO WE KNOW WE'RE NOT IT?
