    WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ORIGINS, NOT MERELY SCIENCE.   SCIENCE CANNOT
    EXPLAIN ORIGINS.  FOR A PERSON TO EXCLUDE ANYTHING BUT SCIENCE FROM
    THE ISSUE OF ORIGINS IS TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO HIGHER TRUTH
    THAN SCIENCE.  THIS IS A FALSE PREMISE.  BY THE WAY, I ENJOY SCIENCE.
    IT IS TRULY A WONDER OBSERVING GOD'S CREATION.  MACROEVOLUTION IS
    A MIXTURE OF 15 PERCENT SCIENCE AND 85 PERCENT RELIGION [GUARANTEED
    WITHIN THREE PERCENT ERROR :) ]
