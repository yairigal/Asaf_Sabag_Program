                            FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       BY ROBERT E. MCELWAINE, PHYSICIST
          
               NINETY TO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY "KNEW" THAT A 
          HEAVIER-THAN-AIR MACHINE COULD NOT POSSIBLY FLY.  IT WOULD 
          VIOLATE THE "LAWS" OF PHYSICS.  ALL OF THE "EXPERTS" AND 
          "AUTHORITIES" SAID SO. 
          
               FOR EXAMPLE, SIMON NEWCOMB DECLARED IN 1901:  "THE 
          DEMONSTRATION THAT NO POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF KNOWN 
          SUBSTANCES, KNOWN FORMS OF MACHINERY AND KNOWN FORMS OF 
          FORCE, CAN BE UNITED IN A PRACTICAL MACHINE BY WHICH MAN 
          SHALL FLY LONG DISTANCES THROUGH THE AIR, SEEMS TO THE WRITER 
          AS COMPLETE AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF ANY 
          PHYSICAL FACT TO BE." 
          
               FORTUNATELY, A FEW SMART PEOPLE SUCH AS THE WRIGHT 
          BROTHERS DID NOT ACCEPT SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS AS THE FINAL 
          WORD.  NOW WE TAKE AIRPLANES FOR GRANTED, (EXCEPT WHEN THEY 
          CRASH). 
          
               TODAY, ORTHODOX PHYSICISTS AND OTHER "SCIENTISTS" ARE 
          SAYING SIMILAR THINGS AGAINST SEVERAL KINDS OF 'FREE ENERGY' 
          TECHNOLOGIES, USING NEGATIVE TERMS SUCH AS "PSEUDO-SCIENCE" 
          AND "PERPETUAL MOTION", AND CITING SO-CALLED "LAWS" WHICH 
          ASSERT THAT "ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED OR DESTROYED" ("1ST LAW 
          OF THERMODYNAMICS") AND "THERE IS ALWAYS A DECREASE IN USEFUL 
          ENERGY" ("2ND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS").  THE PHYSICISTS DO NOT 
          KNOW HOW TO DO CERTAIN THINGS, SO THEY ARROGANTLY DECLARE 
          THAT THOSE THINGS CANNOT BE DONE.  SUCH PRINCIPLES OF 
          IMPOTENCE ARE COMMON IN ORTHODOX MODERN "SCIENCE" AND HELP TO 
          COVER UP INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS IN ORTHODOX 
          MODERN THEORIES. 
          
               FREE ENERGY INVENTIONS ARE DEVICES WHICH CAN TAP A 
          SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF ENERGY FROM THE UNIVERSE, WITH-
          OUT BURNING ANY KIND OF FUEL, MAKING THEM THE PERFECT 
          SOLUTION TO THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY CRISIS AND ITS ASSOCIATED 
          POLLUTION, DEGRADATION, AND DEPLETION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. 
          
               MOST FREE ENERGY DEVICES PROBABLY DO NOT CREATE ENERGY, 
          BUT RATHER TAP INTO EXISTING NATURAL ENERGY SOURCES BY 
          VARIOUS FORMS OF INDUCTION.  UNLIKE SOLAR OR WIND DEVICES, 
          THEY NEED LITTLE OR NO ENERGY STORAGE CAPACITY, BECAUSE THEY 
          CAN TAP AS MUCH ENERGY AS NEEDED WHEN NEEDED.  SOLAR ENERGY 
          HAS THE DIS-ADVANTAGE THAT THE SUN IS OFTEN BLOCKED BY 
          CLOUDS, TREES, BUILDINGS, OR THE EARTH ITSELF, OR IS REDUCED 
          BY HAZE OR SMOG OR BY THICK ATMOSPHERE AT LOW ALTITUDES AND 
          HIGH LATITUDES.  LIKEWISE, WIND SPEED IS WIDELY VARIABLE AND 
          OFTEN NON-EXISTENT.  NEITHER SOLAR NOR WIND POWER ARE 
          SUITABLE TO DIRECTLY POWER CARS AND AIRPLANES.  PROPERLY 
          DESIGNED FREE ENERGY DEVICES DO NOT HAVE SUCH LIMITATIONS. 
          
               FOR EXAMPLE, AT LEAST THREE U.S. PATENTS (#3,811,058, 
          #3,879,622, AND #4,151,431) HAVE SO FAR BEEN AWARDED FOR 
          MOTORS THAT RUN EXCLUSIVELY ON PERMANENT MAGNETS, SEEMINGLY 
          TAPPING INTO ENERGY CIRCULATING THROUGH THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC 
          FIELD.  THE FIRST TWO REQUIRE A FEEDBACK NETWORK IN ORDER TO 
          BE SELF-RUNNING.  THE THIRD ONE, AS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN 
          "SCIENCE & MECHANICS" MAGAZINE, SPRING 1980, ("AMAZING 
          MAGNET-POWERED MOTOR", BY JORMA HYYPIA, PAGES 45-48, 114-117, 
          AND FRONT COVER), REQUIRES CRITICAL SIZES, SHAPES, 
          ORIENTATIONS, AND SPACINGS OF MAGNETS, BUT NO FEEDBACK.  SUCH 
          A MOTOR COULD DRIVE AN ELECTRIC GENERATOR OR REVERSIBLE 
          HEATPUMP IN ONE'S HOME, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [COMPLETE 
          DESCRIPTIVE COPIES OF U.S. PATENTS ARE $3.00 EACH FROM THE 
          U.S. PATENT OFFICE, 2021 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY., ARLINGTON, VA  
          22202; CORRECT 7-DIGIT PATENT NUMBER REQUIRED.  OR TRY

               A SECOND TYPE OF FREE-ENERGY DEVICE, SUCH AS THE 'GRAY 
          MOTOR' (U.S. PATENT #3,890,548), THE 'TESLA COIL', AND THE 
          MOTOR OF INVENTOR JOSEPH NEWMAN [SEE SCIENCE, 2-10-84, PAGES 
          571-2.], TAPS ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ENERGY BY INDUCTION FROM 
          'EARTH RESONANCE' (ABOUT 12 CYCLES PER SECOND PLUS
