      Ive deleted it now in the interest of brevity Go back a step 
and youll see it was still in your post Yes that was my claim if you 
can refute it then please do so 
 
Firstly an apology  You hadnt deleted your claim and I was mistaken in 
saying you had Sorry for any offence caused 
 
Secondly  how can I refute your definition  I can only point up its 
logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage 
of the word objective in other areas  Indeed by your definition an 
objective x is an oxymoron for all x  I have no quibble with that 
belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly 
good word

      How many ages can the universe have and still be internally self 
consistent Id be amazed if it was more than one How many different 
moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single 
individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together 
 
Begging the question  People can have many opinions about the age 
of the universe and humanity can still stick together   You are 
saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about 
it  Why 
 
      The age of the universe like most scientific facts can be 
emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter 
who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the 
largish side  
 
This assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality 
which doesnt depend on what we think   Why should an extreme Biblical 
Creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak 
 
Ive heard of no way to verify morality in a 
consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to 
enlighten me 
 
The same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted 
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess  I wrote 
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses
