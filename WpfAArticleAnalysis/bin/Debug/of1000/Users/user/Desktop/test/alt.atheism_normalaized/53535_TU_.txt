TO ALL A.A READERS:
     I HAVE BEEN ASKED BE SEVERAL OF YOU TO POST A LIST OF THE SDA CHURCH'S 
27 FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS.  I WARN YOU NOW, IT'S A LONG LIST.  HOWEVER, I'LL 
POST IT ON SUNDAY.  SABBATH IS COMING UP SOON SO I WON'T BE READING ON 
SATURDAY.  AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT NOW.
     I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD KEEP ME IN TOUCH WITH WHAT'S 
GOING ON.
     I HOPE ALL OF YOU HAVE A REASTFUL AND RELAXING WEEKEND.  I HOPE IT'S 
THE BEST ONE SO FAR!!

TAMMY
