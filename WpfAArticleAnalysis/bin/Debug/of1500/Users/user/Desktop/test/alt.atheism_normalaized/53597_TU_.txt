WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A "_CHEMIST_" AND SOMEONE WHO IS TAUGHT
CHEMISTRY AT, SAY, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY?

> I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT P.W. ATKINS'S CLASSIC TEXT _PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY_

HAS THERE BEEN SOME REVOLUTION IN TEACHING METHODS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS?

PERHAPS THE CONFUSION COMES FROM THE FACT THAT I WAS THINKING OF ORGANIC
CHEMISTRY, WHEREAS YOU WERE THINKING OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.
