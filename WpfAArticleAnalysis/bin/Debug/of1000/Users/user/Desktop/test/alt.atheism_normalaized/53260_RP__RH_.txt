You also have no reason to believe it *is* an antiIslamic slander job apart 
from your own prejudices

Why yes  Whats a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed 
Islamic banking rules  Gregg *knows* Islam is good and he *knows* BCCI were 
bad therefore BCCI *cannot* have been Islamic  Anyone who says otherwise is 
obviously spreading slanderous propaganda

I see  If someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with 
you will also respond with references to articles you agree with  Mmm yes 
that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate  Doubtless thats how 
you spend your time in soccultureislam 
 
Ive got a special place for you in my 
 
kill file  Right next to Bobby  Want to join him 
 
The more you post the more I become convinced that it is simply a waste of 
time to try and reason with Moslems  Is that what you are hoping to achieve
