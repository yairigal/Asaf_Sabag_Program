No youre just overloading the word value again It is an 
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth 
Shit I dont even know what worth means Consider the possibility 
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe 
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value 
science at all  
 
But once you make a decision on the value of truth and the likelihood of  
science getting it the rest follows  In your example science is necessarily 
worthless and so are its results because truth is worthless assuming thats 
all science is good for  And its no accident that phrases such as good 
for fit so naturally in this context 
 
Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression 
and asking how much you value life both involve the word value doesnt 
mean that they refer to the same thing at all I understand that 
the word value is used for both but you have to be clear in what 
sense you are using the words I agree with judging science as a 
value in the first sense but not the second 
 
But I dont use it in the second sense  Consider that F=ma is no  
different than F=3 until I note the connection with reality that F=ma has and 
F=3 does not  Im making a decision as to the importance of F=ma 
over other expressions I can compute  Im valuing it whether implicitly or 
directly because Im saying that things that have a basis in reality 
are different to other things which do not  And noone points 
out an unimportant difference except to say that its unimportant 
Important useful worthy etc are all words with evaluative 
power quite different from evaluating an expression  Im careful 
to use value in the sense I mean which is invariably the first

Huh What are you talking about People frequently point out the 
point I made above That is what I mean by observed 
 
OK I misunderstood  I thought you meant observed in the sense 
of notquitesureobservations by which I mean those undertaken 
by people

Truth by blatant assertion again Frank Its observationally the 
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well 
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring 
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared 
It doesnt take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations 
 
Yes it does  Youre saying in effect it works independently of what I 
believe and basing that statement on your reasonable assumption ie  
unsupported belief that it works indepently of what you believe It 
begs the question rather obviously  And of course reasonable 
assumption seems to be weasel words for seems useful useful 
belonging to world of ghosts and values and therefore being unreal
