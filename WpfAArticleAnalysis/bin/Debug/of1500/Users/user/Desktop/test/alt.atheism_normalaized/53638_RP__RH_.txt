Liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion including if 
Im not mistaken the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait  Never invaded 
Nicaragua  Only with more word games can you say send in the 
Marines

Oh good word games  If you let the aggressor pick the words 
theres scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action

Thats a convenient technique much seen on altatheism define those 
who disagree with you according to a strawman extreme that matches 
virtually nobody

Very noble and patriotic  Im sure the fine young Americans who 
carpetbombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon 
destroyed Iraqs sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the 
sky or further or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their 
trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were 
just thrilled to be risking death if not risking it by much in the 
defense of the liberty of  well wealthy Kuwaitis  Cant have 
those oilfields under a tyrants heel if that tyrant is antagonistic 
to US interests

Having pigeonholed peaceniks in this context people who 
disagree with me about the conduct of the Gulf War into 
peaceatallcosthitlersupportinggenocideabettingwimps you can 
now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold 
and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms  HOW DARE 
THEY

Yes hypocrisy indeed  Those violent peaceniks  Care to list an 
example here 
 
>All to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up  
>and defend our freedoms against tyrants and who realize that to do 
>so requires a strong national defense 
 
Wow instant 80s nostalgia  Of course peacenik itself is a 
50s Cold War derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism 
with Godless Pinko Communists  Yes indeed I felt my freedoms 
mightily threatened by Iraq
