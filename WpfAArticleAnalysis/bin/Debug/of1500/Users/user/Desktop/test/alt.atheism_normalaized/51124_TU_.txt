IT WAS NO CRITICISM OF ISLAM FOR A CHANGE, IT WAS A CRITICISM OF THE
ARGUMENTS USED. NAMELY, WHENEVER PEOPLE YOU IDENTIFY AS MUSLIMS ARE
THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACKS OF OTHERS, THEY ARE USED AN ARGUMENT FOR
THE BAD SITUATION OF MUSLIMS. BUT WHENEVER DEEDS BY MUSLIM THAT VICTIMIZE
OTHERS ARE NAMED, THEY DO NOT COUNT AS AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE WHAT THESE
PEOPLE DID WAS NOT DONE AS A TRUE MUSLIMS. NO MENTION IS MADE HOW MUSLIMS
ARE THE CAUSE OF A BAD SITUATION OF ANOTHER PARTY.
 
DOUBLE STANDARDS.
