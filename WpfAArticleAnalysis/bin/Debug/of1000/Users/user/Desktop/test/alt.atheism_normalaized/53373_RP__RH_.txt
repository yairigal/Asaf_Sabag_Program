Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy  Just what organization did he  
belong to Does it have a name

Logic alert  artificial trifercation  The are many other possible explainations  Could have been 
that he never existed  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  
impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to mind

Logic alert   argument from incredulity  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesnt 
mean that it isnt true  Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself site 
He has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die 
By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  
he believes  As far as healing goes  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not 
consistent between the different gospels  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  
that faith healers can pull off today  Seems to me that the early gospels werent that compeling 
so the stories got bigger to appeal better

Or might not have existed or any number of things  That is the logical pitfall that those who 
use flawed logic like this fall into  There are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because 
in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  
possible  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among 
the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding 
all other possible alternatives 
 
However if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the  
incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices  I have given at  
least one valid alternative so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isnt one of 
the other two alternative is no longer valid

JC was a rabbi  He knew what those prophecies were  It wouldnt be any great shakes to make 
sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy  What would be compeling is if there 
were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then  yet  
fullfilled them anyway

Here I agree with you  Anyone who buys into this load
