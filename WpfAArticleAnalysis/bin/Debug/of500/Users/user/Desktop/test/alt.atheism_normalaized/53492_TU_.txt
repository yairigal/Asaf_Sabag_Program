THANKS JON.  I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE 1912 AND 1927 INVASIONS (IF I HAD
EVER LEARNED OF THEM.  I MEAN I *REALLY* FORGOT!)  BUT I READ THE CONTEXT
AS MORE RECENT, SUCH AS WHEN THE SANDINISTAS WERE EXPECTING AN "IMMINENT"
INVASION FROM THE U.S. WHICH NEVER HAPPENED.

I STAND CORRECTED.  THANKS.

I REMEMBERED THIS ONE.  THIS ONE AND BUSH'S INVASION WERE THE TWO I
MENTIONED ABOVE.  GOOD OL' TEDDY R.-- HE KNEW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE!
