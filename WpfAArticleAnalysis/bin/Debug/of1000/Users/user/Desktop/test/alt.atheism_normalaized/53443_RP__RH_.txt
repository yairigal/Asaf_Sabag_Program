Occams Razor is not a law of nature it is way of analyzing an 
argument even so it interesting how often its cited here and to 
what end  
It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being 
primitive simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and 
childish and yet again condemned as being too complex Occams 
razor the scientific explanation of things being much more 
straightforeward and apparently simpler Which is it to be  which 
is the nonessential and how do you know 
Considering that even scientists dont fully comprehend science due to 
its complexity and diversity Maybe William of Occam has performed a 
lobotomy kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away  
 
This is all very confusing Im sure one of you will straighten me out 
tough
