Anton LaVeys interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me  I 
read his Satanic Bible a few years ago for a social studies project 
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called The Cult of Devil Worship 
in America  The latter included a very interesting interview with 
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an 
instrument for one to realize the self   
 
When I refer to Satanism I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic 
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan  I 
dont consider LaVeys church to be at all orthodox nor do I consider 
its followers satanists  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche 
Crowley and Reich slapped in some religious doctrine added a little 
touch of PT Barnum and christened his creation the Church of Satan 
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attentionI 
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex 
 
At any rate it worked for a while  In its heyday the Church had a 
huge following including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis Jr 
and Jayne Mansfield  I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy by the  
way   
 
I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as 
a Christian not believing in Christ  But if you include the Church of 
Satan then I suppose I need to alter my definition  Websters Dictionary 
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same
