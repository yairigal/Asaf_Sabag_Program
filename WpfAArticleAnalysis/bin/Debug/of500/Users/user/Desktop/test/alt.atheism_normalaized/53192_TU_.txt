SEE, WE ARE DISAGREEING ON THE DEFINITION OF MORAL HERE.  EARLIER, YOU SAID
THAT IT MUST BE A CONSCIOUS ACT.  BY YOUR DEFINITION, NO INSTINCTIVE
BEHAVIOR PATTERN COULD BE AN ACT OF MORALITY.  YOU ARE TRYING TO APPLY
HUMAN TERMS TO NON-HUMANS.  I THINK THAT EVEN IF SOMEONE IS NOT CONSCIOUS
OF AN ALTERNATIVE, THIS DOES NOT PREVENT HIS BEHAVIOR FROM BEING MORAL.

I TRY TO SHOW IT, BUT BY YOUR DEFINITION, IT CAN'T BE SHOWN.

AND, MORALITY CAN BE THOUGHT OF A LARGE CLASS OF PRINCPLES.  IT COULD BE
DEFINED IN TERMS OF MANY THINGS--THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IF YOU WISH.  HOWEVER,
IT SEEMS SILLY TO TALK OF A "MORAL" PLANET BECAUSE IT OBEYS THE LAWS OF
PHYICS.  IT IS LESS SILLY TO TALK ABOUT ANIMALS, AS THEY HAVE AT LEAST
SOME FREE WILL.
