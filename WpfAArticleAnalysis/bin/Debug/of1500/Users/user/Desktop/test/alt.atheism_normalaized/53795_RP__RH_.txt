This is still contradictory It reduces to 
 
  1 Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug 
 
  2 this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for 
       bug meaning that it doesnt lend more weight to one than to the 
       other 
 
  3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence 
       can exist for bug 
 
But 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 When you say paraphrased 
in 2 that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you 
mean is that its no *more* evidence for benefactor than it is for bug 
 
Yes thats what I mean 
 
In 3 however youve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor 
so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than 
relative evidence for benefactor wrt bug 
 
Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other  I 
think this is just a communications problem   What I am trying to say 
in my clumsy way is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates 
to theism making predictions prayer your Rapture example I dont 
buy your use of Occams razor in all cases where A=0 
 
In my example one couldnt dismiss 
benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity  one of these is necessary 
to explain the dosh  I brought up the onebyone dismissal process to 
show that it would be wrong to do so  From what youre saying in this 
post it seems you agree and were talking at crosspurposes 
 
3 is still in contradiction to 1 
 
Some sums may help With B = benefactor b = bug d = dosh arrives in account 
 
  1 implies  PB+b | d = 1 
 
Assuming that PBb | d = 0 so its either the benefactor *or* a bug 
which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then 
 
   PB+b | d   =   PB | d + Pb | d 
 
so 
 
   PB | d + Pb | d  =  1 
 
but 3 implies that 
 
   PB | d  =  0  and  Pb | d  =  0 
 
No this isnt what I meant  PB | d = 05 and Pb | d = 05 with 
necessarily no new observation weve already seen the dosh to change 
those estimates  I was trying to say again in my clumsy way that 
it would be wrong to assign 0 probability to either of these  And thats 
precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods  gods are 
one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of 
hypotheses oneofwhich is necessary to explain something which otherwise  
would not be satisfactorily explained  It can be thrown out or 
retained on grounds of nonrational preference not of science or statistics    
Alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds 
that the answer cant be known or that the notional probability estimates 
are effectively useless being equal agnosticismweak atheism

Exactly the point I was making I think So we dont throw out any of 
these contrary to your assertion above that we do 
 
Some people do Simon and they think they are doing excellent science 
My sole point was that they arent

You said the diametric opposite which I guess is the source of my confusion 
 
I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so

On the contrary those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which 
can be discarded using the Razor See my post on the other branch of this 
thread 
 
Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of  If 
the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses  Which 
means that youre assigning Px | Hi =0 for all i though weve already 
established that its not correct to do so when SUMPx|Hi=1 over 
all i
