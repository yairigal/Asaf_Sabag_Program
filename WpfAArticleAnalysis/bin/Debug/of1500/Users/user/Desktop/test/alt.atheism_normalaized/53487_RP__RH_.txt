The reference to its not yet being ethics is dubious You have used the terms 
absolute objective and others interchangeably Same with moral values values 
at all worth measuers and usefulness You infer from them as if they were 
the same 
  
To the IF When the If is not fulfilled your intermission is a waste of time 
Assuming that you dont intend this it is reasonable to conclude that you 
want to argue a point 
  
You have made a interesting statement here namely that of the disinterested 
observer There is no such thing in morals Probably the shortest proof for 
objective and morality being a contradiction

Fine And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon I could 
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite Not that that wasnt 
mentioned before In other words you have nothing to fulfill your strong 
claims with

Clutching a straw I dont believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were 
loaded terms are fixpoints Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite 
clear what they say their practice is telling Yes there are even those who 
are willingly unfree It is quite common in religions by the way For one 
there is a religion which is named Submission 
  
Dont even try to argue that submission is freedom

If it were so it would argue my case But I am afraid that that is considered 
proof

There is something universally valued in a moral context
