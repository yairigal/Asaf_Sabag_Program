Whats your point

MAYBE TO ME In this example and as I argue below thats not even 
true

Not necessarily

But science is also good for technology which may or may not 
have anything to do with truth I may value technology and 
not truth after all

Spare me This is nonsense Frank Pregnancy is sometimes referred 
to as having a bun in the oven Does this mean that the uterus 
is at 450 F Argument by idiom is weak indeed and its what 
youre engaging in here

Of course its different 3=ma What is at issue is accuracy 
not difference 
 
>Im making a decision as to the importance of F=ma 
>over other expressions I can compute 
This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value 
of understanding the universe One can make the observation 
that IF one wanted to understand the universe F=ma would be 
valuable without believing F=ma to be valuable Frank 
 
>Im valuing it whether implicitly or

>are different to other things which do not 
Things which have a basis in reality are different from things 
which have a basis in reality Quantum mechanics is very different 
from biochemistry yet they both allegedly have basises in reality 
Look Frank noone said that people didnt do science because they 
value itin the sense of think it is good but that is not necessary 
to make the observation that its results have value in the sense 
that they are accurate Allow me to give you an example I think 
that knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless 
I dont care to know it but I would be quite prepared to 
note as valuable ie accurate the claim that it was Bigendian 
if it was shown to be so like by showing me the manual

No its fleeking not Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense 
of evaluating an expression accuracy It has nothing to do with 
importance worthiness or usefulness Choice of problems DOES 
have to do with those factors but they are orthogonal to 
evaluating for accuracy solutions to chosen problems

No I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure

Frank you are attempting to inject goodness judgements where there 
are only accuracy judgements by essentially punning on the word 
value which has both meanings useful is a goodness judgement 
Reasonable is an accuracy judgement They are not the same 
thing at all Useful in making some conclusion is an accuracy 
judgement again Im afraid Sorry Frank but all youre doing is 
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue IF you 
mean to say that science is based on value accuracy judgements 
I have no problem with that If you mean to say that its based 
on value goodness judgements thats nonsense By contrast 
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements
