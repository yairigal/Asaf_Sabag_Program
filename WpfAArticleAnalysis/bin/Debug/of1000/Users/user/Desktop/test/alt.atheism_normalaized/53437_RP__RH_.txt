 I do think so and isnt there a clear connection with the I do 
 believe because it is absurd notion by one of the original 
 Christians Origen 
 
There is a similar statement attributed to Anselm I believe so that

anyone posting here could accept which means that neither statement 
can be properly analysed in this venue
