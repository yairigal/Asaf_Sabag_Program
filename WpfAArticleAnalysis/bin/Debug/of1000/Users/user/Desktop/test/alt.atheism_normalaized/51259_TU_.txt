APPARENTLY NOT.

IN RESPONSE TO HIS CLAIM THAT IT "TERRIFIES" GAY PEOPLE NOT TO BE ABLE
TO "INDOCTRINATE CHILDREN TO OUR LIFESTYLE" (OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT),
I SENT ROGER A VERY CALM, CAREFULLY-WRITTEN, DETAILED LETTER
EXPLAINING SIMPLY WHY THE BSA POLICY DOES, INDEED TERRIFY ME.  I DID
NOT USE INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE AND LEFT MYSELF EXTREMELY OPEN FOR AN
ANSWER.  THUS FAR, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ANSWER.  I CAN CONCLUDE ONLY
THAT ROGER CONSIDERS HIS POSITION EITHER INDEFENSIBLE OR SIMPLY NOT
WORTH DEFENDING.

>TRYING TO CLOUD THE ISSUE
>WITH COMPARISONS TO BLACKS OR OTHER MINORITIES IS ALSO MEANINGLESS
>BECAUSE IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES (I.E., PEOPLE CAN'T
>CONTROL THEIR RACE BUT THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR).

IN FACT, THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT: PEOPLE CAN CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR.
BECAUSE OF THAT FACT, THERE IS NO NEED FOR A BLANKET BAN ON
HOMOSEXUALS.

>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO POSSIBLY DISCUSS ON REC.SCOUTING ON THIS ISSUE?

YOU TELL ME.
