Sigh now I dont feel so bad  Searching for a copy in bookstores has 
been a habit of mine for at least two years now  I spend a *lot* of  
time browsing through bookstores new and and used and Ive not once 
seen a copy  Now I know all I do is pick up a phone and order the 
darned thing but come on this is America and hes one of the founding 
fathers  And no one carries his books  Sure you can find Common 
Sense but I think thats because its required reading for most 
colleges   
 
I did find one holeinthewall bookstore where the owner said that they  
usually carry one or two copies but that they were currently out I havent 
been back since so I dont know if he was telling the truth or not 
 
sigh
