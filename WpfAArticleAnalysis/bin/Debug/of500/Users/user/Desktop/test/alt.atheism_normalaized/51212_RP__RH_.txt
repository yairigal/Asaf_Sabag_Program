I am not aware of any Turkish Caliphate viewpoint on this Can you 
reference 
 
However I found a quote due to Imam Ali whom the Shias follow 
 
Men never obey your women in any way whatsoever Never let them give their 
advice on any matter whatsoever even those of everyday life Indeed allow 
them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away ones 
wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth 
  We see them without religion when alone they are left to their own 
devices they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal 
desires are at stake It is easy to enjoy them but they cause great 
anxiety The most virtious among them are libertines But the most 
corrupt are whores Only those of them whom age has deprived of any 
charm are untainted by vice They have three qualities particular to 
miscreants they complain of being oppressed whereas it is they 
who oppress they make oaths whereas they are lying they pretend 
to refuse mens solicitations whereas they desire them most ardently 
Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds 
And preserve us in any case from their good ones 
 
Quote from Masud alQanawi ref A Bouhdiba Sexuality in Islam  
p 118 
 
I wouldnt consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic TM 
viewpoint though  For all we know the prophets cousin and 
the Fourth Khalif Hazreti Ali may have said this after a frustrating  
night with a woman
