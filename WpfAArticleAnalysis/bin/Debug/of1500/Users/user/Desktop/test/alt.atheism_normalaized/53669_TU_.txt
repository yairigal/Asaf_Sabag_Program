NO ONE ASKS YOU TO SWALLOW EVERYTHING, IN FACT JESUS WARNS AGAINST IT.   BUT LET
ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.  DO YOU BELEIVE WHAT YOU LEARN IN HISTORY CLASS, OR FOR
THAT MATTER ANYTHING IN SCHOOL.  I MEAN IT'S JUST WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TOLD
YOU AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SWALLOW WHAT OTHERS SAY. RIGHT ... ?

THE LIFE , DEATH, AND RESURECTION OF CHRIST IS DOCUMENTED HISTORICAL FACT.  AS MUCH
AS ANYTHING ELSE YOU LEARN.  HOW DO YOU CHOOSE WHAT TO BELIEVE AND WHAT NOT TO?
I COULD ARGUE THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON IS A MYTH.  HE NEVER LIVED BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANY PROOF EXCEPT WHAT I AM TOLD.   HOWEVER ALL THE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE LIFE
OF JESUS CHRIST WERE FORTOLD HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE HIM.  NEAT TRICK UH?

THERE IS NO WAY TO GET INTO A SCEPTICAL HEART.  YOU CAN NOT SAY YOU HAVE GIVEN A 
SINCERE EFFORT WITH THE ATTITUDE YOU SEEM TO HAVE.  YOU MUST TRUST, NOT JUST GO 
TO CHURCH AND PARTICIPATE IN IT'S ACTIVITIES.  WERE YOU EVER WILLING TO DIE FOR WHAT
YOU BELIEVED?
