You have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes Repeating 
offenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at 
all Typically religious doublespeak Whenever you have contradictory 
statements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument 
  
It is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make Theodore KKKaldis 
feel cozy can go along under the protection of religion 
  
Gregg tell us would you kill idolaters
