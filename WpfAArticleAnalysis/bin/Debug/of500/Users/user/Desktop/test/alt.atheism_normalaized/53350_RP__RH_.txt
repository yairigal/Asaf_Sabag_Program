I looked back at this and asked some questions of various people and 
got the following information which I had claimed and you poohpoohed 
The US has not sold Iraq any arms  Their navy is entirely made of 
FUSSR vessels  Their airforce not including stuff captured from Kuwait 
which I am not as sure about doesnt include any US equipment  Their 
missiles are all nonUS  Their tanks are almost all soviet with about 
100 French tanks older ones The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal 
is a few M113s  Those were not sold to Iraq  Iraq captured them from 
other countries like Kuwait  Information is hard to prove  You are 
claiming that the US sold information  Prove it  
 
Now how did the US build up Iraq again  I just gave some fairly 
conclusive evidence that the US didnt sell arms to Iraq  Information 
is hard to prove almost certainly if the US did sell information then that 
fact is classified and you cant prove it  If you can provide some 
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq 
I am very interested but not if you just make claims based on what 
everyone knows
