I DON'T HAVE A STAT, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I DID READ GENERALLY THAT BOTH SMOKING
AND BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL (OCCULTISH GARBAGE) IS ON THE RISE HERE.

THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.  I THING THE PRINCIPLE IS SORT OF THE SAME THOUGH:
ALL "PHILOSOPHICAL" IDEAS ARE GENERALLY TRIED OUT AND TESTED MOSTLY DURING
COLLEGE YEARS.  WHETHER THE IDEA IS CHRISTIAN OR ATHEIST DOESN'T ALWAYS MATTER.
BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY IT'S BECAUSE ATHEISTS ARE MORE INTELLIGENT  :)
