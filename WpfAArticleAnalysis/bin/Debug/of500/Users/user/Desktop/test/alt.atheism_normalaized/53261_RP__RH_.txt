The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to  
But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love 
you because you made them love you or because they wanted to 
love you     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward 
Him  He promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself 
Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort 
Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see 
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic 
Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is 
the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
know more than you do now   To learn you must accept that which 
you dont know
