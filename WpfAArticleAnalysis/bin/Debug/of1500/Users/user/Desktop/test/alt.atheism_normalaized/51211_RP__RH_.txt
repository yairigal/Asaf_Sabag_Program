Do you have any evidence for this If the code was once perfect and 
has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour 
of this statement shouldnt we 
 
Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full 
of noncoding regions introns which are so called because they 
intervene with the coding regions exons An impressive amount of 
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is 
likely that early exons represented early protein domains 
 
Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing It appears that 
intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually 
have quite similar exonintron structure in their genes  
 
On the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted 
later presents several logical difficulties Introns are removed 
by a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unused 
if introns are inserted Moreover intron insertion would have 
required precise targeting  random insertion would not be tolerated 
since sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mRNA are 
conserved Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a 
trace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications and 
these are not found in or near intron sequences  
 
I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and 
genetics before posting theological arguments like this  
Try Watsons Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish 
 Baltimores Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters 
 
 Remember the question was posed in a theological context Why does 
 God cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a 
 theological perspective  my own  It is no less valid than a purely 
 scientific perspective just different 
 
Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas  
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion 
  
 I think you misread my meaning  I said God made the genetic code perfect 
 but that doesnt mean its perfect now  It has certainly evolved since 
 
For the worse Would you please cite a few references that support 
your assertion Your assertion is less valid than the scientific 
perspective unless you support it by some evidence 
 
In fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps 
more important than weve thought  for instance sex might 
have evolved as defence against parasites This view is supported by 
computer simulations of evolution eg Tierra  
  
 Perhaps  I thought it was higher energy rays like Xrays gamma 
 rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage 
 
In fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although 
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action  
 
 Actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the 
 time when God created life  According to my recollection most 
 biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago  after 
 all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth 
 was created  It would still be too primitive to support life  I 
 seem to remember a figure more like 25 to 3 billion years ago for 
 the origination of life on earth  Anyone with a better estimate 
 
Id replace created with formed since there is no need to  
invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one 
Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 46  48 
billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but 
organic stromatolitelike layers date back to 35 billion years 
This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to 
evolve 
 
Im sorry I cant give any references this is based on the course 
on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here  
 
 >>dominion it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer 
 >>diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  Although the forces of

Again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for 
this supposed degeneration  
 
I can understand Scotts reaction

 In response to your last statement no and neither do you 
 You may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you 
 cannot *know* that 
 
I hope you dont forget this We have evidence that suggests  
everything can come about spontaneously Do you have evidence against 
this conclusion In science one does not have to believe in  
anything It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve But the  
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so 
and not to present ones own conclusions prior to this  
 
Theology does not use this method Therefore I seriously doubt 
it could ever come to right conclusions 
 
 >>Human DNA being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely 
 >>affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the  
 >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  
 >>causing infection and disease  It is a bad combination  Hence 
 >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial 
 >>diseasesdisorders 
 
You are supposing a purpose not a valid move Bacteria and viruses 
do not exist to cause disease They are just another manifests of 
a general principle of evolution  only replication saves replicators 
from degradiation We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  
survive and replicate The less efficient methods didnt make it  
to the present  
 
And for the last time  Please present some evidence for your claim that 
human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes Some people have 
claimed that the opposite is true  we have suppressed our selection 
and thus are bound to degrade I havent seen much evidence for either 
claim 
  
 But then I ask So  Where is this relevant to my discussion in 
 answering Johns question of why  Why are there genetic diseases 
 and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require 
 babies to develop antibodies  Is it Gods fault the original 
 question  I say no it is not 
 
Of course nothing evil is gods fault  But your explanation does 
not work it fails miserably 
  
 You may be right  But the fact is that you dont know that 
 Satan is not responsible and neither do I 
  
 Suppose that a powerful evil being like Satan exists  Would it 
 be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills 
 that affect mankind  I dont think so 
 
He could have done a much better Job Pun intended The problem is 
it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are 
just as inevitable as any product of evolution 
 
 Did I say that  Where  Seems to me like another bad inference 
 Actually what youve done is to oversimplify what I said to the 
 point that your summary of my words takes on a new context  I 
 never said that people are meant presumably by God to be 
 punished by getting diseases  Why I did say is that free moral 
 choices have attendent consequences  If mankind chooses to reject 
 God as people have done since the beginning then they should not 
 expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic
