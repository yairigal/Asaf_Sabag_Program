Well thats the endpoint problem again   Being able to  
distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man  
of peace does not mean that you have a method for telling 
whos a terrorist in general 
 
Of course we *try* to tell them apart but for my money 
its better to try with the full awareness that we all 
bring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we are 
using some objective test
