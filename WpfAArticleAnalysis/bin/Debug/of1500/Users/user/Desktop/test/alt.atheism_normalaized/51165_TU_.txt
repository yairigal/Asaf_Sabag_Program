# I HOPE I GAVE YOU A FAIRLY SOLID ANSWER TO THIS ONE: I SIMPLY DON'T AGREE
# WITH THE EMBODIED VERSION OF A SATAN WHO IS A SEPARATE CREATION OR A FORCE.
# I WROTE:

>> THE BELIEF TO WHICH I ASCRIBE IS THAT EVIL IS NOT A CREATION;
>> RATHER, IT IS "THE ABSENCE OF GOOD."  THIS FITS WITH ALL THE
>> LOGIC ABOUT THINGS HAVING DUAL USE: E.G., A KNIFE CAN BE USED
>> TO SCULPT AND IT CAN BE USED TO KILL.  LIKE ENTROPY, EVIL IS
>> SEEN IN THIS VIEW AS NEITHER FORCE NOR ENTITY.  SATAN IS,
>> THEREFORE, METAPHORICAL.  IN FACT, THERE ARE SEVERAL VERSES
>> OF THE HOLY QUR'AN WHICH APPEAR TO SUPPORT THIS VIEW AND SEVERAL
>> TRADITIONS AS WELL.
>
>> FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A TRADITION THAT FOOD SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT OPEN
>> ON A SHELF OR TABLE OVERNIGHT, LEST "SATAN" ENTER IT.  IT APPEARS
>> THAT THIS IS A REFERENCE TO AS YET UNDISCOVERED GERMS; THUS, THE
>> EVIL EFFECT OF SPOILED FOOD IS DESCRIBED AS "SATAN."

>BUT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF SATAN PERSONIFIED.  WHICH AM I
>     TO BELIEVE?

# AND THERE ARE QUITE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF HEAVEN AND HELL IN THE
# HOLY QUR'AN, THE BIBLE, ETC.  THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN THE SPIRITUAL
# AND INTELLECTUAL EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN HUMAN WHEN THESE PHYSICAL
# DESCRIPTIONS OF HEAVEN, HELL, AND SATAN WERE TAKEN QUITE LITERALLY
# AND THAT *WORKED* FOR THE TIME.  AS I MENTIONED IN THE TRADITION
# CITED ABOVE, FOR EXAMPLE, IT WAS SUFFICIENT IN THE ABSENCE OF A THEORY
# ABOUT GERMS AND DISEASE SPREAD BY WORMS TO SIMPLY DESCRIBE THE "EVIL"
# WHICH WAS PASSED TO A CONSUMER OF SPOILED FOOD AS "SATANIC."

     WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION: IF SATAN IN THIS CASE IS
     METAPHORICAL, HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN ALLAH IS NOT
     THE SAME WAY?

# THE BOTTOM LINE HERE, HOWEVER, IS THAT DESCRIBING A SPIRITUAL PLANE
# IN HUMAN LANGUAGE IS SOMETHING LIKE DESCRIBING "COLOR" TO A PERSON
# WHO HAS BEEN BLIND FROM BIRTH.  YOU MAY WANT TO READ THE BOOK
# FLATLAND (IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY) OR THE DRAGON'S EGG.  THE FIRST
# IS INTENDED AS A LIGHT HEARTED DESCRIPTION OF A MATHEMATICAL CON-
# CEPT...

[SOME DELETED FOR SPACE SAVING]

# WHEN LANGUAGE FAILS BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE USED TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE
# ANOTHER DIMENSION WHICH CANNOT BE EXPERIENCED BY THE SPEAKERS, THEN
# SUCH CONVENTIONS AS METAPHOR, ALLEGORY, AND THE LIKE COME TO BE
# NECESSARY.  THE "UNSEEN" IS DESCRIBED IN TERMS WHICH HAVE REFERENCE`
# AND MEANING FOR THE READER/LISTENER.  BUT, LIKE ALL MODELS, A COMPRO-
# MISE MUST BE MADE WHEN SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY: CLARITY AND DIRECTNESS
# OF MEANING, EQUIVALENCE OF PERCEPTION, AND THE LIKE ARE ALL
# CRIPPLED.  BUT WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

     THIS IS WHY I ASKED THE ABOVE.  HOW WOULD YOU THEN
     KNOW GOD EXISTS AS A SPIRIT OR BEING RATHER THAN
     JUST BEING METAPHORICAL?  I MEAN, IT'S OKAY TO SAY
     "WELL, SATAN IS JUST METAPHORICAL," BUT THEN YOU
     HAVE TO JUSTIFY THIS BELIEF AND JUSTIFY THAT GOD IS
     NOT SOME METAPHOR FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

     I SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY, MANY INSTANCES OF
     SATAN DESCRIBED AS A BEING (SUCH AS THE TORMENTOR IN 
     THE OLD TESTAMENT BOOK OF JOB, OR THE TEMPTOR IN THE
     NEW TESTAMENT GOSPELS).  IN THE SAME WAY, GOD TOO IS
     DESCRIBED AS A BEING (OR SPIRIT.)  HOW AM I TO KNOW
     ONE IS METAPHORICAL AND NOT THE OTHER.

     FURTHER, BELIEF IN GOD ISN'T A BAR TO EVIL.  LET'S
     CONSIDER THE CASE OF SATANISTS: EVEN IF SATAN WERE
     METAPHORICAL, THE SATANIST WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE
     IN GOD TO JUSTIFY THIS BELIEF.  AGAIN, WE HAVE A 
     CASE WHERE SOMEONE DOES BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT BY
     RELIGIOUS STANDARDS, THEY ARE "EVIL."  IF BOBBY
     DOES SEE THIS, LET HIM ADDRESS THIS QUESTION ALSO.

[DELETED SOME MORE ON "METAPHOR"]

>> OBVIOUSLY MORE PHILOSOPHIZING ON THIS ISSUE IS POSSIBLE, BUT I'M
>> NOT SURE THAT THE READERS OF THIS NEWSGROUP WOULD WANT TO DELVE
>> INTO RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION FURTHER.  HOWEVER, IF ANYONE WISHES
>> TO DISCUSS THIS, I'M CERTAINLY WILLING (EITHER OFF LINE - E-MAIL - OR
>> ON LINE - POSTING).
