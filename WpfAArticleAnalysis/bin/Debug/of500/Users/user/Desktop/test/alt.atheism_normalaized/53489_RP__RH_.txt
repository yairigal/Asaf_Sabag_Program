This is the most unmitigated bilge Ive seen in a while Jim Brown obviously 
has possession of the rightwing token 
 
> Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective 
 
In December former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a 
Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq 100 million per day and 
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world 
Iraq he suggested was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands 
while the community of nations won every day  with no taking of life or 
loss of life   FCNL Washington Newsletter

BULLSHIT In the Gulf Massacre 7 of all ordnance used was smart The 
rest  thats 93  was just regular dumb ol iron bombs and stuff Have 
you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch 
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage Or that a 
successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud 
passed each other in the same area of the sky 
 
And of the 7 that was the smart stuff 35 hit Again  try to follow me 
here  that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed
