HI!

I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MORMONS, AND I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SERIOUS INDEPENDENT
STUDIES ABOUT THE BOOK OF MORMON.

I DON'T BUY THE 'OFFICIAL' STORY ABOUT THE GOLD ORIGINAL TAKEN TO HEAVEN,
BUT HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK OF MORMON BY MYSELF (I HAVE TO MUCH WORK LEARNING
BIBLICAL HEBREW), I WILL APPRECIATE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THE RESULTS OF STUDY
IN STYLE, VOCABULARY, PLACE-NAMES, INTERNAL CONSISTENCY, AND SO ON.

FOR EXAMPLE: THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR ONE-WRITER OR MULTIPLE WRITERS?
THERE ARE SOME MENTION ABOUT EVENTS, PLACES, OR HISTORICAL PERSONS LATER
DISCOVERED BY ARCHEOLOGIST?

YOURS IN COLLEN
