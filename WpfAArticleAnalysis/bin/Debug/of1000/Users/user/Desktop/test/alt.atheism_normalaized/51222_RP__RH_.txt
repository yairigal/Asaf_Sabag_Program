The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity 
statements since the is in those statements is the is of predication 
rather than of identity  Instead they should be translated using a 
predicate letter  Using g to designate God and j to designate Jesus 
and the predicate letter E for the property of being eternal the 
first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej 
    The second premise appears to contain an is of identity in which 
case it can be properly symbolized as j = g  But your remark that Jesus 
is a subset of God suggests that strict identity is not desired here 
If however the first premise means that all members making up the set 
God have the property of being eternal the same conclusion follows
