	THIS IS NOT  STRICKLY CORRECT. ONLY BY INCORRECT APPLICATION OF THE 
RULES OF LANGUAGE, DOES IT SEEM TO WORK.

	THE MERCEDES IN THE FIRST PREMIS, AND THE ONE IN THE SECOND ARE NOT 
THE SAME MERCEDES. 

	IN YOUR CASE, 

	A = B
	C = D
	
	A AND D ARE NOT EQUAL. ONE IS A NAME OF A PERSON, THE OTHER THE
NAME OF A OBJECT. YOU CAN NOT SIMPLY EXTRACT A WORD WITHOUT TAKING THE 
CONTEXT INTO ACCOUNT. 

	OF COURSE, YOUR CASE DOESN'T IMPLY THAT A = D.

	IN HIS CASE, A DOES EQUAL D.


	TRY AGAIN...
