Gregg Im really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice 
things arent quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim 
them to be upsets you but exactly who is being childish here is  
open to question 
 
BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank  
what will someone bet me they werent real Islamic owners and 
operators  and yet it actually turned out to be a longrunning 
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often 
quite naive depositors 
 
And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into 
BCCI rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down 
the street   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned  
and operated bank couldnt possibly cheat them  
 
So please dont try to con us into thinking that it will all  
work out right next time
