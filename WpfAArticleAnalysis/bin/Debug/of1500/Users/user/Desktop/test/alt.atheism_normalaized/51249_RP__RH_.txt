Actually it is simple 
 
A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders 
of X at the time when C was committed  It doesnt matter if the physical 
manifestation of C is outside X 
 
For instance if I hack into NASAs Ames Research Lab and delete all their 
files I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom  If the US authorities 
wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law they have no automatic 
right to do so 
 
This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites 
in Holland  Holland had no anticracking legislation and so it was viewed 
as a hacker haven by some US system administrators 
 
Similarly a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic 
material which can be received in Britain  If they were broadcasting in 
Britain they would be committing a crime  But they are not they are 
broadcasting from Denmark so the British Government is powerless to do 
anything about it in spite of the apparent lawbreaking 
 
Of course Im not a lawyer so I could be wrong  More confusingly I could 
be right in some countries but not in others
