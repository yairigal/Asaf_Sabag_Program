Ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead 
to intolerance  So do you also oppose all ideologies 
 
I dont think your argument is an argument against religion at all but 
just points out the weaknesses of human nature

One must approach the Quran with intelligence  Any thinking approach 
to the Quran cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it 
that women and men are spiritual equals 
 
I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have 
souls  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be 
forgiven  Or to have a great reward understood to be in the 
afterlife  I think the usual answer would be no  in which case the 
part saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward 
says they have souls   
 
If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then  
I have no idea what a soul is 
 
As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority 
in all interpretations any thinking approach to the Quran has to give 
all verses of the Quran equal priority  That is because according to 
Muslim belief the whole Quran is the revelation of God  in fact 
denying the truth of any part of the Quran is sufficient to be 
considered a disbeliever in Islam

Look any approach to the Quran must be done with intelligence and 
thought  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the 
Qurans message  In a book of finite length it cannot explicitly 
answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings 
it can guide you  I think however that women are the spiritual equals 
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that 
since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have 
souls from the above verse 
 
Lets try to understand what the Quran is trying to teach rather than 
try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this 
passage or that passage  The misinterpretations of the Quran based on 
ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations  
fully consistent are more limited  Lets try to discuss these 
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can 
ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try 
to twist Islam for their own ends  something I do not deny
