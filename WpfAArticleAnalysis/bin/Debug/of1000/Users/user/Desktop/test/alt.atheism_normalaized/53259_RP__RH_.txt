Just for the record  not that any kind of information would be 
likely to affect your thinking  I have an MSEE  focus in 
Electromagnetics  from Penn 
 
A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make 
What was observed is something we can measure that matches what  
the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted   
 
Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and a 
wave model for light the atomic model is a mathematical 
representation of physical phenomena  A model that can and 
probably will continue to change over time  That makes it  
subjective the model that is  However the model gives us an 
objective way to talk about the physical world 
 
To put it another way the Quantum Mechanical model of the atom 
allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and 
unambiguous results which is objective  However as Bohr and 
Einstein duked it out midcentury the interpretation of 
those reapeatable observable measurements is quite subjective 
Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was 
inherent in the nature of the universe  Einstein said particle 
motion was deterministic but it was our measurement shortcomings 
that introduced the randomness  They were talking about the 
EXACT same results though
