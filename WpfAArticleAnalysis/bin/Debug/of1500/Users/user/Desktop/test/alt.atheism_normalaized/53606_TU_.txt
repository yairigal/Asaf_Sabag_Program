I THINK THIS SHOULD BE ILLUMINATING TO ALL. LET ME MAKE A FIRST
SUGGESTION. WHEN ARABIC WORDS, ESPECIALLY TECHNICAL ONES, BECOME OF USE 
LET US DEFINE THEM FOR THOSE, ESPECIALLY ATHEISTS, TO WHOM THEY MAY NOT BE
TERRIBLY FAMILIAR. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THOUGH I DID INITIALLY REFER
TO KHOMEINI AS A HERETIC FOR WHAT I UNDERSTOOD TO BE A CLAIM -- REJECTED 
BY YOU SINCE -- OF PERSONAL INFALLIBILITY, I WITHDRAW THIS AS A BASIS
FOR SUCH A STATEMENT. I CONDITIONALLY RETAIN THIS REFERENCE IN REGARD
TO KHOMEINI'S ADVOCACY OF THE THESIS OF THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE 
SO-CALLED "TWELVE IMAMS," WHICH IS IN CLEAR CONFLICT WITH THE QUR'AN 
IN THAT IT PLACES THE TWELVE IMAMS IN A CATEGORY OF BEHAVIOR AND EXAMPLE
HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE MUHAMMAD, IN THAT THE QUR'AN SHOWS THAT THE
PROPHET WAS CLEARLY FALLIBLE, AS WELL AS (IT APPEARS, GIVEN YOUR
ABSTRUSE THEOLOGICAL STATMENT REGARDING THE "NATURES"  OF THE TWELVE
IMAMS) PLACING THEM IN A DIFFERENT METAPHYSICAL CATEGORY THAN THE 
REMAINDER OF HUMANITY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF MUHAMMAD, 
SOMETHING WHICH VERGES ON THE SIN OF ASSOCIATION.
