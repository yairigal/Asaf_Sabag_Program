COULD AN ATHEIST ACCEPT A USAGE IN WHICH RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OR
TRADITION IS VIEWED IN A METAPHORICAL WAY?  OF COURSE: THIS IS
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE DO WITH HOMER, OR WITH OTHER CONCEPTS SUCH AS
FATE, LUCK, FREE WILL ;-)...  HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF -- SAY -- CHRISTIANITY IS A
PARTICULARLY *GOOD* SET OF METAPHORS FOR THE WORLD TODAY.  IT'S ALSO
ENTIRELY UNCLEAR, AND TO ME QUITE UNLIKELY, THAT ONE COULD TAKE A
CONTEMPORARY RELIGION LIKE THAT AND DIVORCE THE METAPHORIC POTENTIAL
FROM THE LITERALISM AND ABSOLUTISM IT CARRIES NOW IN MANY CASES.
