Of course if youre planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring ones 
leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to ones 
other plans 
 
 
In Rushdies case the one under discussion one can It is tragic that 
in some Islamic countries this is so There are however Islamic 
countries whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is 
to be incorporated eg Kuwait where one can freely make such 
statements without fear

This story has become tiresome The conditions are clear If you care to 
make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made 
public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of TSV If 
he did make such statements then he should have made that clear rather 
than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal 
feelings
