Let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact  
different than not believing in a god or gods  
 
I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist 
does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement  
that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I dont   
know and therefore dont believe in them and dont NOT believe in then 
weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than saying   
I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the position even  
after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith 
 
But first let me say the following 
We might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and 
existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist 
To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE 
being  God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not 
exist He is eternal With this said I feel its rather pointless 
to debate the so called existence of God  and that is not what 
Im doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of 
being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this 
statement
