No I spent a month just reading too mainly because I did not know 
much about the way atheists think I even printed out the FAQs and 
discussed it with a friend before I started posting 
 
Altatheism deals with religious issues more appropriately lack of 
religious beliefs which are by their very nature very controversial 
It makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make 
sure you are not repeating something others have said better
