(ABOUT MY REPLY)

> DIPLOMATIC :-)

IT A SOCIETY THAT IS CONSTANTLY ON THE VERGE OF FLAMING, USENET, DIPLOMACY
IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THE VOICE OF REASON GETS THROUGH, ISN'T IT?

KEVIN, UNFORTUNATELY YOU ARE NOW DELVING INTO FIELD I KNOW TOO LITTLE
ABOUT, ALGORITHMS. YOUR REASONING, AS I SEE IT, IS VERY MUCH ALONG THE
LINES OF ROGER PENROSE, WHO CLAIMED THAT MATHEMATICAL 'INSIGHT' CANNOT
BE ALGORITHMIC IN HIS BOOK _THE EMPEROR'S NEW MIND: CONCERNING
COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS_. HOWEVER, PENROSE'S
CLAIM THAT HE _HAS_ MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT, OR YOUR SIMILAR CLAIM
THAT WAVEFUNCTIONS COLLAPSE ONLY WHEN WE CONSCIOUSLY TAKE A LOOK,
COULD BE JUST ILLUSIONS.

WE ARE OBVIOUSLU TAKING VERY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS - I TRY TO PONDER
ON THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE,
REALISING THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE ANYTHING SPECIAL, BUT CERTAINLY
USEFUL. THINKING BACK OF WHAT I WROTE, DO YOU THINK WORMS HAVE MINDS
OR NOT? THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE PAIN, AT LEAST THEY BEHAVE 
JUST LIKE THAT. YET IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT WE MIGHT SOME DAY
IN THE FUTURE PERFORM A "TOTAL SYNTHESIS OF C. ELEGANS" FROM
THE ELEMENTS. WOULD SUCH A WORM HAVE A MIND?

THIS IS TRUE TO SOME EXTENT. HOWEVER, I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR BRAINS
WORK LIKE COMPUTERS, AT ALL. IN FACT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
(SKARDA, 1985; SKARDA & FREEMAN 1987) THAT BRAINS WORK MORE OR LESS
CHAOTICALLY, GENERATING ENOUGH RANDOMNESS FOR MENTAL STATES TO EVOLVE.
OUR BRAINS WORK MUCH LIKE GENETIC ALGORITHM GENERATORS, I SUPPOSE.

INDEED, THIS IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY, GIVEN THE VAST IMPACT OF NURTURE
ON OUR MIND AND BRAIN. I SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT BEFORE TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AS A COLLECTION OF ALGORITHMS. 

KEVIN, TAKE A LOOK AT THE REFERENCES I MENTIONED, AND THINK AGAIN.
I STILL THINK THE BEST EXPERTS ON THE NATURE OF A CONSCIOUS MIND
ARE NEUROLOGISTS, NEUROPSYCHOLOGISTS AND BIOLOGISTS (BUT DO NOT 
FLAME ME FOR MY OPINIONS), SINCE THEY STUDY BEINGS THAT ARE
CONSCIOUS. 

THE REASON I AM REPEATING MY ADVICE IS THAT THIS DISCUSSION CANNOT
LEAD TO ANYWHERE IF OUR BACKGROUNDS ARE TOO DIFFERENT.

AND PLEASE, DO NOT BRING QM INTO THIS DISCUSSION AT ALL - NOT
ALL PHYSICISTS ARE HAPPY WITH THE CLAIM THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
PLAYS SOME SPECIAL ROLE IN PHYSICS. I WOULD SAY IT DOESN'T.
