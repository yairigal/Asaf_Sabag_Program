Once again this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling 
between some software cracks 
 
In article jaegerbuphybuedu Gregg Jaeger writes 
>As promised here is Rafiq Zakarias discussion of the nature of 
>the socalled satanic verses from which Rushdies title has been 
>taken Rafiq Zakaria Muhammad and the Quran Penguin 91 
 
Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an 
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldnt actually 
 have happened  The historicity of the episode doesnt matter to what 
 follows 
 
I dont know whether Im quoting Gregg or Zakaria below  Anyway back 
to current affairs 
 
>Rushdie has by his own admission drawn 
>on the version given by the orientalist Watt  
 
Among others this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone 
else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you 
will known according to Umar Khan to Every Muslim school boy and 
girl and so presumably to Rushdie and to Gibreel Farishta 
 
>and then allowed his 
>imagination to run wild  
 
Yes this is what writing fiction is all about  Rushdie was writing 
about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing 
the actor Gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took 
Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims 
or implies that this is what actually happened  Its somewhat like 
stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed 
prostitute Mary Magdalene another myth  Or those referring to the 
Arthurian mythos or the Grail legend or the Wandering Jew or dozens 
of others  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer 
consider Salman Rushdies childrens book Haroun and the Sea of 
Stories for an idea of the way a storyteller  a specific 
storyteller  works with existing story lines 
 
>to ridicule Muhammads integrity 
 
No  Muhammads Mahounds integrity is not really impugned in this 
part of the story and theres no reason to think this was Rushdies 
intent Gibreel as the archangel produces the verses divine and 
satanic though he doesnt know their provenance  It is not implied 
in a straight reading that Muhammad influences them 
 
     *Not my voice* Id never know such words Im no classy speaker 
    never was never will be but this isnt my voice its a Voice 
      Mahounds eyes open wide hes seeing some kind of vision 
    staring at it oh thats right Gibreel remembers me  Hes 
    seeing me  My lips moving being moved by  What whom  Dont 
    know cant say  Nevertheless here they are coming out of my 
    mouth up my throat past my teeth the Words 
      Being Gods postman is no fun yaar 
      Butbutbut God isnt in this picture 
      God knows whose postman Ive been 
 
Its ambiguous is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel  Is it Satan 
Or something else  The answer is not given 
 
To be sure the question is raised  This novel explores faith and the 
role of revelation in religion among other things  Addressing loss 
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation 
but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly  The very 
existence of a newsgroup named altatheism raises the same 
questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is 
the real relevance  If Rushdies mild fictional exploration is filth 
and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa 
list  Thats a rhetorical question of course
