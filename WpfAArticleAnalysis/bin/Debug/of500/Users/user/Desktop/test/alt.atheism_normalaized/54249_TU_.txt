                            FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       BY ROBERT E. MCELWAINE, PHYSICIST
          
               NINETY TO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY "KNEW" THAT A 
          HEAVIER-THAN-AIR MACHINE COULD NOT POSSIBLY FLY.  IT WOULD 
          VIOLATE THE "LAWS" OF PHYSICS.  ALL OF THE "EXPERTS" AND 
          "AUTHORITIES" SAID SO. 
          
               FOR EXAMPLE, SIMON NEWCOMB DECLARED IN 1901:  "THE 
          DEMONSTRATION THAT NO POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF KNOWN 
          SUBSTANCES, KNOWN FORMS OF MACHINERY AND KNOWN FORMS OF 
          FORCE, CAN BE UNITED IN A PRACTICAL MACHINE BY WHICH MAN 
          SHALL FLY LONG DISTANCES THROUGH THE AIR, SEEMS TO THE WRITER 
          AS COMPLETE AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF ANY 
          PHYSICAL FACT TO BE." 
          
               FORTUNATELY, A FEW SMART PEOPLE SUCH AS THE WRIGHT 
          BROTHERS DID NOT ACCEPT SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS AS THE FINAL 
          WORD.  NOW WE TAKE AIRPLANES FOR GRANTED, (EXCEPT WHEN THEY 
          CRASH). 
          
               TODAY, ORTHODOX PHYSICISTS AND OTHER "SCIENTISTS" ARE 
          SAYING SIMILAR THINGS AGAINST SEVERAL KINDS OF 'FREE ENERGY' 
          TECHNOLOGIES, USING NEGATIVE TERMS
