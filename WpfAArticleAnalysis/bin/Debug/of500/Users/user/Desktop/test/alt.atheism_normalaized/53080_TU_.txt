YES IT WOULD.  LUCKILY THESE PARAMETERS ARE FIXED BY REALITY.  IF I CAN
PREDICT WITH ALMOST 100% ACCURACY THAT AMERICANS PREFER TO OWN THEIR PORTIONS OF
THE US THAN AN INFINITESMAL PORTION OF $1, IN WHAT SENSE ARE THESE VALUES
NOT OBJECTIVE?  I DON'T THINK I'M WAY OFF BEAM IN SAYING THAT "SOMETHING IS
BETTER THAN NOTHING" IS A RATIONAL AND OBJECTIVE VALUATION. DO YOU AGREE
WITH ME THEN THAT THE ASSERTION "NO VALUES ARE OBJECTIVE" IS FALSE?
