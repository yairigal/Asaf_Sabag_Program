SO?
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

>IN YOUR EXAMPLE, SCIENCE IS NECESSARILY
>WORTHLESS,
MAYBE TO ME! (IN THIS EXAMPLE, AND AS I ARGUE BELOW, THAT'S NOT EVEN
TRUE.)

>AND SO ARE ITS RESULTS,
NOT NECESSARILY.

>BECAUSE TRUTH IS WORTHLESS, ASSUMING THAT'S
>ALL SCIENCE IS GOOD FOR.
BUT SCIENCE IS ALSO GOOD FOR TECHNOLOGY, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TRUTH. I MAY VALUE TECHNOLOGY AND
NOT TRUTH, AFTER ALL.

>AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT PHRASES SUCH AS "GOOD
>FOR" FIT SO NATURALLY IN THIS CONTEXT.
SPARE ME. THIS IS NONSENSE, FRANK. PREGNANCY IS SOMETIMES REFERRED
TO AS HAVING A "BUN IN THE OVEN." DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE UTERUS
IS AT 450 F? ARGUMENT BY IDIOM IS WEAK INDEED, AND IT'S WHAT
YOU'RE ENGAGING IN HERE.

>#MEAN THAT THEY REFER TO THE SAME THING AT ALL. I UNDERSTAND THAT
>#THE WORD VALUE IS USED FOR BOTH, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN WHAT

OF COURSE IT'S DIFFERENT. $3!=MA. WHAT IS AT ISSUE IS ACCURACY,
NOT DIFFERENCE.

>I'M MAKING A DECISION AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF F=MA
>OVER OTHER EXPRESSIONS I CAN COMPUTE.
THIS IS THE RESULT OF A CHAIN OF DEDUCTION ABOUT THE VALUE
OF UNDERSTANDING THE UNIVERSE. ONE CAN MAKE THE OBSERVATION
THAT IF ONE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE, F=MA WOULD BE
VALUABLE WITHOUT BELIEVING F=MA TO BE VALUABLE, FRANK.

>I'M VALUING IT, WHETHER IMPLICITLY OR
>DIRECTLY, BECAUSE I'M SAYING THAT THINGS THAT HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY
>ARE DIFFERENT TO OTHER THINGS WHICH DO NOT.
THINGS WHICH HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THINGS
WHICH HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY. QUANTUM MECHANICS IS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM BIOCHEMISTRY, YET THEY BOTH (ALLEGEDLY) HAVE BASISES IN REALITY.
LOOK, FRANK, NOONE SAID THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY
VALUE IT(IN THE SENSE OF THINK IT IS GOOD), BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARY
TO MAKE THE OBSERVATION THAT IT'S RESULTS HAVE VALUE (IN THE SENSE
THAT THEY ARE ACCURATE.) ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE: I THINK
THAT KNOWING THE BYTE ORDER ON IBM 3090S IS PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS
(I DON'T CARE TO KNOW IT) BUT I WOULD BE QUITE PREPARED TO
NOTE AS VALUABLE (I.E. ACCURATE) THE CLAIM THAT IT WAS BIG-ENDIAN
IF IT WAS SHOWN TO BE SO (LIKE, BY SHOWING ME THE MANUAL.)

> AND _NO-ONE_ POINTS
>OUT AN _UNIMPORTANT_ DIFFERENCE, _EXCEPT_ TO SAY THAT IT'S UNIMPORTANT.
>"IMPORTANT", "USEFUL", "WORTHY", ETC. ARE ALL WORDS WITH EVALUATIVE
>POWER, QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EVALUATING AN EXPRESSION.  I'M CAREFUL
>TO USE "VALUE" IN THE SENSE I MEAN, WHICH IS INVARIABLY THE FIRST.
NO, IT'S FLEEKING NOT. SCIENTIFIC JUDGEMENT IS SOLELY THE SENSE
OF EVALUATING AN EXPRESSION (ACCURACY). IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
IMPORTANCE, WORTHINESS, OR USEFULNESS. CHOICE OF PROBLEMS DOES
HAVE TO DO WITH THOSE FACTORS, BUT THEY ARE ORTHOGONAL TO
EVALUATING (FOR ACCURACY) SOLUTIONS TO CHOSEN PROBLEMS.

>#>THE CONCEPT OF A DES BOX WHICH CAN BE ASSUMED TO WORK AS YOU DESCRIBE IN 
>#>THE ABSENCE OF AN ASSUMPTION OF OBJECTIVE REALITY IS INCOHERENT.  SUCH A BOX 
>#>MAY AS WELL BE ASSUMED TO WEAR A DUFFLECOAT AND GO TO THE LIMERICK RACES.
>#TRUTH BY BLATANT ASSERTION AGAIN, FRANK. IT'S OBSERVATIONALLY THE

>#ASSUMED THAT IT WILL WORK EVEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT MEASURING IT, BARRING
>#QUANTUM SILLINESS ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT HAVE DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED.
>#IT DOESN'T TAKE A NOTION OF OBJECTIVE REALITY TO DISCUSS MY OBSERVATIONS.
>YES IT DOES.  YOU'RE SAYING IN EFFECT "IT WORKS INDEPENDENTLY OF WHAT I
>BELIEVE", AND BASING THAT STATEMENT ON YOUR "REASONABLE ASSUMPTION" (I.E. 
>UNSUPPORTED BELIEF) THAT IT WORKS INDEPENTLY OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
NO, I WAS SAYING THAT IT WORKS INDEPENDENTLY OF WHETHER I MEASURE
IT, WHICH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.

> IT
>BEGS THE QUESTION RATHER OBVIOUSLY.
IT WOULD IF THEY WERE THE SAME THING, WHICH THEY ARE NOT.

>  AND OF COURSE, "REASONABLE
>ASSUMPTION" SEEMS TO BE WEASEL WORDS FOR "SEEMS USEFUL", "USEFUL"
>BELONGING TO WORLD OF GHOSTS AND VALUES, AND THEREFORE BEING UNREAL.  
FRANK, YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO INJECT "GOODNESS" JUDGEMENTS WHERE THERE
ARE ONLY "ACCURACY" JUDGEMENTS, BY ESSENTIALLY PUNNING ON THE WORD
'VALUE' WHICH HAS BOTH MEANINGS. "USEFUL" IS A GOODNESS JUDGEMENT.
"REASONABLE" IS AN ACCURACY JUDGEMENT. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME
THING AT ALL. ("USEFUL IN MAKING SOME CONCLUSION" IS AN ACCURACY
JUDGEMENT AGAIN, I'M AFRAID.) SORRY, FRANK, BUT ALL YOU'RE DOING IS
USING THE AMBIGUITY OF ENGLISH TO OBFUSCATE THE ISSUE. IF YOU
MEAN TO SAY THAT SCIENCE IS BASED ON VALUE (ACCURACY) JUDGEMENTS,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. IF YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT IT'S BASED
ON VALUE (GOODNESS) JUDGEMENTS, THAT'S NONSENSE. BY CONTRAST,
MORALITY IS CLEARLY BASED ON GOODNESS JUDGEMENTS.
