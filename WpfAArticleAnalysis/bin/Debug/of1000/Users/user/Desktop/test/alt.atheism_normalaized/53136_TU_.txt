THIS ISN'T THE GUY WHO WAS A LAWYER WAS HE?  COULD YOU GIVE MORE INFO ON THIS
GUY (NEVER MIND- I'M SURE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF RESPONSES TO THIS POST, AND
IT WILL APPEAR THERE)

THIS IS TRUE.  MAKE SURE IT IS TRUE FOR ALL CASES.

WHY NOT DIE FOR A LIE?  IF YOU WERE POVERTY STRICKEN AND ALUNATIC, SOUNDS
PERFECETLY REASOABLE TO ME.  AS TO WHETHER THE SOCIETAL DREGS HE HAD FOR
FOLLOWERS WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR OR NOT, NOT NECESSARILY.
EVEN IF HE DIED FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, THIS STILL MAKES HIM COMPLETELY
SELFISH.  LIKE US ALL.  SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

THERE IS NO HISTORICAL PROOF OF THIS (SEE EARLIER THREADS).  BESIDES, HE (OR AT
LEAST HIS NAME), HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF ENOUGH DEATHS TO MAKE UP FOR WHATEVER
HEALING HE GAVE.

SIEG HEIL!!

WHO IS DAVID KORESH?  I AM CURIOUS.

HOW DOES THIS FOLLOW?  YOUR DEFINITION OF LUNATIC (AND "DISPROOF" THEREOF SEEM
RATHER... UHHH.. SHAKY)

GOOD IDEA.
