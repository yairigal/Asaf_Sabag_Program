HUH?  PLEASE EXPLAIN.  IS THERE A PROBLEM BECAUSE I BASED MY MORALITY ON 
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE WRONG?  GOSH, THERE'S A HECK OF A LOT OF STUFF THAT I 
BELIEVE THAT COULD BE WRONG, AND THAT COMES FROM SOURCES THAT COULD BE WRONG. 
WHAT DO YOU BASE YOUR BELIEF ON ATHEISM ON?  YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND REASONING? 
COULDN'T THAT BE WRONG?
