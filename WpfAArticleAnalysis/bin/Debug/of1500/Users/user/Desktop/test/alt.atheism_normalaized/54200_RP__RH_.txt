      AH But what exactly is inherently abhorrent and WHY is it so 
What youre saying is in effect I think some things are repulsive 
and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me so they 
should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever period 
 
      Which in and of itself is nice enough to some extent I agree with 
you But I do not agree that things are inherently or absolutely 
immoral they are labeled immoral each for its own good reason and if 
the reason can even theoretically change then so can the label

      No it doesnt Humans are to some extent similar because we all 
belong to the same species that that species has evolved is another 
story altogether To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence 
to moral absolutism of a flavour

      Youre saying morality is whatll keep society alive and kicking 
It is I think up to a point but societies are not all alike and 
neither are their moralities

      Similar = identical

      No its falsifiable through finding someoe who was created 
different whatever that might be in the real world
