>>>THIS WHOLE THREAD STARTED BECAUSE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER
>>>OR NOT THE DEATH PENALTY CONSTITUTED CRUEL PUNISHMENT, WHICH IS FORBIDDEN
>>>BY THE US CONSTITUTION.
>>YES, BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY WHAT THEY MEANT BY "CRUEL", WHICH IS WHY
>>A) YOU HAVE THE SUPREME COURT, AND B) IT MAKES NO SENSE TO REFER
>>TO THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS QUITE SILENT ON THE MEANING OF THE
>>WORD "CRUEL".
>
>THEY SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THE WORDING OF THE CONSTITUTION.  THEY
>PICKED WORDS WHOSE MEANINGS IMPLIED THE INTENT.  WE HAVE ALREADY LOOKED
>IN THE DICTIONARY TO DEFINE THE WORD.  ISN'T THIS SUFFICIENT?

	WE ONLY NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION: WHAT DID THE FOUNDING FATHERS 
CONSIDER CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT?

	HANGING? HANGING THERE SLOWING BEING STRANGLED WOULD BE VERY 
PAINFUL, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALL, I IMAGINE.

	FIRING SQUAD ? [ NOTE: NOT A CLEAN WAY TO DIE BACK IN THOSE 
DAYS ], ETC. 

	ALL WOULD BE CONSIDERED CRUEL UNDER YOUR DEFINITION.
	ALL WERE ALLOWED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
