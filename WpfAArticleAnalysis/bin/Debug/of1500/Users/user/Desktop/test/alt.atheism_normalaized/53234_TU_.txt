NOTICE THE FOLLOWUP-LINE.

IN ARTICLE <1993APR15.223844.16453@RAMBO.ATLANTA.DG.COM> WPR@ATLANTA.DG.COM (BILL RAWLINS) WRITES:
>    WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ORIGINS, NOT MERELY SCIENCE.   SCIENCE CANNOT
>    EXPLAIN ORIGINS.

SO YOU HAVE CLAIMED, BUT YOU HAVE NEVER EXPLAINED WHY. IN DETAIL.

  FOR A PERSON TO EXCLUDE ANYTHING BUT SCIENCE FROM
>    THE ISSUE OF ORIGINS IS TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO HIGHER TRUTH
>    THAN SCIENCE.  THIS IS A FALSE PREMISE.  BY THE WAY, I ENJOY SCIENCE.
>    IT IS TRULY A WONDER OBSERVING GOD'S CREATION.  MACROEVOLUTION IS
>    A MIXTURE OF 15 PERCENT SCIENCE AND 85 PERCENT RELIGION [GUARANTEED
>    WITHIN THREE PERCENT ERROR :) ]

AGAIN, YOU HAVE CLAIMED THIS, BUT YOU HAVE NEVER EXPLAINED. YOU NEVER
DID EXPLAIN HOW DEDUCING MACROEVOLUTION FROM ITS OBSERVABLE CONSEQUENSES
(EFFECTS) IS DIFFERENT FROM DEDUCING EARTH'S ROUNDNESS, ITS POSITION IN
THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE EXISTENCE OF ATOMS AND ITS COMPONENTS ETC., FROM
OBSERVABLE EFFECTS.
PLEASE DO SO OR SHUT UP ON THIS SUBJECT.
