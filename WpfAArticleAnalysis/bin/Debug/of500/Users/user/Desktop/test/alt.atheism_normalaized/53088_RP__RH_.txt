	Yes 
 
	If ones particular goal is to land a man on the moon or to  
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate  
then orbital astronomy will be more important 
 
	However if one is a particular fan Sonics singing or a competator  
of Sonic say Mario and the Toadstools knowing when he will record an ablum  
would be more important 
 
	I fail to see how this is connected in any way nor where you are  
driving too 
 
 
   Only when the Sun starts to orbit the Earth will I accept the Bible
