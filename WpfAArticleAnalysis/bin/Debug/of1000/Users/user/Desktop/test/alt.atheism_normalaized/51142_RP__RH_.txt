Well Ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this is 
objectively a murder  However who is at blame is another question 
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions 
realizing the risksis to blame

Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing 
any raondom activity  Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally 
from the rest of society because of this

And I argue that our law system is a similar risk  Perhaps an innocent 
person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this  In fact 
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment 
of innocents

But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals 
on the road  Again the blame is on society

Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case  The state can only do 
so much to prevent false witnesses

Okay so this is what you call murder  But the question is whether or not 
all such murders are wrong  Are you saying that all taking of human life 
is wrong no matter what the circumstances

But this is basically how it works  Society accepts the risk that an 
innocent person will be murdered by execution  And every member of 
society shares this blame  And most peoples definitions of murder 
include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an 
execution is it

Murder violates the golden rule  Executions do not because by allowing 
it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the 
innocent victim is

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction 
was moral or not  But in an objective system only the absolute truth 
matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth  That 
is twelve members must be convinced of a truth
