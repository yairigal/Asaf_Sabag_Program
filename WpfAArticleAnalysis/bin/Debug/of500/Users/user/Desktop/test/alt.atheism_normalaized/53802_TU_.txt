SO?
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

>WORTHLESS,
MAYBE TO ME! (IN THIS EXAMPLE, AND AS I ARGUE BELOW, THAT'S NOT EVEN
TRUE.)

>AND SO ARE ITS RESULTS,
NOT NECESSARILY.

>BECAUSE TRUTH IS WORTHLESS, ASSUMING THAT'S
>ALL SCIENCE IS GOOD FOR.
BUT SCIENCE IS ALSO GOOD FOR TECHNOLOGY, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TRUTH. I MAY VALUE TECHNOLOGY AND
NOT TRUTH, AFTER ALL.

>AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT PHRASES SUCH AS "GOOD
>FOR" FIT SO NATURALLY IN THIS CONTEXT.
SPARE ME. THIS IS NONSENSE, FRANK. PREGNANCY IS SOMETIMES REFERRED
TO AS HAVING A "BUN IN THE OVEN." DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE UTERUS
IS AT 450 F? ARGUMENT BY IDIOM IS WEAK INDEED, AND IT'S WHAT
YOU'RE ENGAGING IN HERE.

OF COURSE IT'S DIFFERENT. $3!=MA. WHAT IS AT ISSUE IS ACCURACY,
NOT DIFFERENCE.

>I'M MAKING A DECISION AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF F=MA
>OVER OTHER EXPRESSIONS I CAN COMPUTE.
THIS IS THE RESULT OF A CHAIN OF DEDUCTION ABOUT THE VALUE
OF UNDERSTANDING THE UNIVERSE. ONE CAN MAKE THE OBSERVATION
THAT IF ONE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE, F=MA WOULD BE
VALUABLE WITHOUT BELIEVING F=MA TO BE VALUABLE, FRANK.

>I'M VALUING IT, WHETHER IMPLICITLY OR

>ARE DIFFERENT TO OTHER THINGS WHICH DO NOT.
THINGS WHICH HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THINGS
WHICH HAVE A BASIS IN REALITY. QUANTUM MECHANICS IS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM BIOCHEMISTRY, YET THEY BOTH (ALLEGEDLY) HAVE BASISES IN REALITY.
LOOK, FRANK, NOONE SAID THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY
VALUE IT(IN THE SENSE OF THINK IT IS GOOD), BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARY
TO MAKE THE OBSERVATION THAT IT'S RESULTS HAVE
