>> WHICH TYPE OF MORALITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  IN A NATURAL SENSE, IT
>> IS NOT AT ALL IMMORAL TO HARM ANOTHER SPECIES (AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
>> ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR OWN, I GUESS).
>HEHEHE, SO YOU SAY, BUT THIS OBJECTIVE MORALITY SOMEHERE TELLS YOU 
>THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE, AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE RULES OF SUCH
>TRANSCENDENTAL GAME SYSTEMS...

WHICH OBJECTIVE SYSTEM ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  WHAT IS ITS GOAL?
AGAIN, WHICH BRAND OF MORALITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
