THAT ("COMPLICATED") ISN'T IN FACT WHERE P(H) > P(HG) COMES FROM; IT'S MORE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND. IT'S FROM

  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  WHERE G' IS THE COMPLEMENT OF G

AND BY AXIOM, P(ANYTHING) >= 0, SO P(HG') >= 0, SO P(H) >= P(HG).

IN A SENSE, HG IS NECESSARILY MORE "COMPLICATED" THAN H FOR ANY H AND G,
SO I MAY BE SPLITTING HAIRS, BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IRRESPECTIVE
OF SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS OF HOW COMPLICATED SOMETHING IS, P(H) >= P(HG)
HOLDS, WITH EQUALITY IF AND ONLY IF P(HG') = 0.

WELL, "P(X | A) = P(X | B)" MEANS THAT X IS AS LIKELY TO BE OBSERVED IF A IS
OPERATIVE AS IT IS IF B IS OPERATIVE. THIS IMPLIES THAT OBSERVING X DOES NOT
PROVIDE ANY USEFUL INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT ALLOW US TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN
THE RESPECTIVE POSSIBILITIES THAT A AND B ARE OPERATIVE; THE DIFFERENCE
REDUCES TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE (UNKNOWN AND UNHELPFUL) PRIOR
PROBABILITIES P(A) AND P(B):

  P(X | A) = P(X | B)  ==>

    P(A | X)  =  K P(A),   AND   P(B | X)  =  K P(B)

WHERE K  =  P(X | A) / P(X)  =  P(X | B) / P(X).

SO A AND B ARE "EQUALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA" IN THAT OBSERVING X
DOESN'T GIVE ANY POINTERS AS TO WHICH OF A OR B IS OPERATIVE.

IN THE PARTICULAR CASE WHERE A = H AND B = HG, HOWEVER, WE KNOW THAT THEIR
PRIOR PROBABILITIES ARE ORDERED BY P(H) >= P(HG), ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW
THE ACTUAL VALUES, AND IT'S THIS WHICH ALLOWS US TO DEPLOY THE RAZOR TO
THROW OUT ANY SUCH HG.

> P(X | HG)"
