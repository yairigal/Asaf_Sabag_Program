Actually Ive got an entire list of books written by various atheist 
authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area Pittsburgh and 
couldnt find any of them  What section of the bookstore do you find 
these kinds of books in  Do you have to look in an alternative bookstore 
for most of them  Any help would be appreciated I can send you the list 
if you want 
 
Thanks
