I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant 
by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the 
law not being enforcible despite the law being applicable

I disagree with this conclusion about the applicability of the  
Islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be The above conclusion  
does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion  
that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law However  
I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were* 
it well founded

Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal  
act according to Islamic law

Yes
