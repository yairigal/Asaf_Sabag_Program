See there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant 
if it is voluntary  Why do you think this 
 
And anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

You are attaching too many things to the term moral I think 
Lets try this  is it good that animals of the same species 
dont kill each other  Or do you think this is right  
 
Or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do 
is either right nor wrong

Those werent arbitrary killings  They were slayings related to some sort 
of mating ritual or whatnot

Yes it was but I still dont understand your distinctions  What 
do you mean by consider  Can a small child be moral  How about 
a gorilla  A dolphin  A platypus  Where is the line drawn  Does 
the being need to be self aware 
 
What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of 
the same species from arbitrarily killing each other  Dont 
you find the fact that they dont at all significant
