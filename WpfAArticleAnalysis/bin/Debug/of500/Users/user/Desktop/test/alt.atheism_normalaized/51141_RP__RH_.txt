This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason  The fact that we 
have trouble talking about something doesnt imply that it is impossible it 
simply implies that it is hard to talk about  There is a very good chance 
that God *can* flibble glop ork groink  Charlie Wingate can flibble glop 
ork groink and he isnt even God
