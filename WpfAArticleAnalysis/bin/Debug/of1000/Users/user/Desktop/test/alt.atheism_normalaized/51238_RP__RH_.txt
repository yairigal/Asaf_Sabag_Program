But you havent taken into the account of propoganda  Remember if you 
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered they would 
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at 
least some were able to tolerate it 
 
You see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general 
frenzy

Well they havent managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity 
of the courts  But they have managed to create quite a few problems for 
people that wanted to have an abortion  They could create similar problems 
for us  And it could be worse  They can try to stop abortions by blocking 
clinics etc but imagine what theyd have to do to stop atheism

So you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a

Yes Id be glad if it were gone to  Ive never supported it  However 
I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted 
with what *could* happen an what may be likely

Well I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key the 
motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed 
in a god  And surely there are a few Christians that think as you say 
but I dont think that most do  Do you think that all Christians actively 
despise other religions  Most that I have met havent and dont do so 
 
>>>No christian 
>>>that I have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them 
>>Why not ask some people of other faiths 
>Sorry I would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here 
>Suppose you could ask a few people 
 
Well I have asked a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of them think 
that it is applicable to them  Of course I cant say that these people 
just some that I know pretty well are accurate representations of their 
faiths

Well Id really like to and Ive tried but I really dont know where to 
get access to Congressional Records from the 1950s  Can anyone help 
out here 
 
>Comparing christians to Nazis Interesting 
 
Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs
