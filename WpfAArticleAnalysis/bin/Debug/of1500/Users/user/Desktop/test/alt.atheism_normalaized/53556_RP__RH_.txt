Referring to the rest mass or what I would just call mass as m0 
 
The new definition is decades old Anyone who has worked with SR 
since then would be familiar with it If most people are familiar 
with m = gamma m0 a highly questionable assertion anyway I would 
expect it is on the large part due to learning SR from lousy 
popularizations instead of proper textbooks

Why should we require E = mc2 even when p = 0 Because its cute 
Saying m = gamma m0 adds confusion For example people might think 
that the formula for kinetic energy still works if m = gaamma m0 ie 
KE = 12 gamma m0 v2  Wrong In fact its gamma  1m0 c2 
However if you say p = gamma m v you always get the right answers 
 
In the end it does boil down to a matter of definition You and I 
both know what is going on and *that* is invariant To say that 
things actually get heavier when moving fast relative to the observer 
misrepresents what is actually going on it is better to say that 
momentum  velocity is observed to increase according to an external 
observer 
 
But people who havent studied SR properly will still make mistakes 
or miss the point regardless of what you call mass

Yes you did From 
 
 Again things get tricky when they move fast  Objects get heavier space 
 gets curved and reality generally fails to live up to ones expectations
