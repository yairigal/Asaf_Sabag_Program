 I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one I simply dont agree 
 with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force

 And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the 
 Holy Quran the Bible etc  There have been times in the spiritual 
 and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical 
 descriptions of Heaven Hell and Satan were taken quite literally 
 and that *worked* for the time  As I mentioned in the Tradition 
 cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory 
 about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil 
 which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic 
 
     Which begs the question if Satan in this case is 
     metaphorical how can you be certain Allah is not 
     the same way 
 
 The bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane 
 in human language is something like describing color to a person 
 who has been blind from birth  You may want to read the book 
 FLATLAND if you havent already or THE DRAGONS EGG  The first 
 is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con 
 cept

 When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe 
 another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then 
 such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be 
 necessary  The unseen is described in terms which have reference 
 and meaning for the readerlistener  But like all models a compro 
 mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness 
 of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all 
 crippled  But what else can you do 
 
     This is why I asked the above  How would you then 
     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than 
     just being metaphorical  I mean its okay to say 
     well Satan is just metaphorical but then you 
     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is 
     not some metaphor for something else 
 
     I say this because there are many many instances of 
     Satan described as a being such as the tormentor in  
     the Old Testament book of Job or the temptor in the 
     New Testament Gospels  In the same way God too is 
     described as a being or spirit  How am I to know 
     one is metaphorical and not the other 
 
     Further belief in God isnt a bar to evil  Lets 
     consider the case of Satanists even if Satan were 
     metaphorical the Satanist would have to believe 
     in God to justify this belief  Again we have a  
     case where someone does believe in God but by 
     religious standards they are evil  If Bobby 
     does see this let him address this question also
