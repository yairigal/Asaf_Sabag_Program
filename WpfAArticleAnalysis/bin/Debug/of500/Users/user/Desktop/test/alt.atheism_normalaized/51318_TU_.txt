IDEOLOGIES ALSO SPLIT, GIVING MORE TO DISAGREE UPON, AND MAY ALSO LEAD
TO INTOLERANCE.  SO DO YOU ALSO OPPOSE ALL IDEOLOGIES?

I DON'T THINK YOUR ARGUMENT IS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST RELIGION AT ALL, BUT
JUST POINTS OUT THE WEAKNESSES OF HUMAN NATURE.

I WOULD LIKE A REFERENCE IF YOU HAVE GOT ONE, FOR THIS IS NEWS TO ME.

>>ANYHOW, THAT WOMEN ARE THE SPIRITUAL EQUALS OF MEN CAN BE CLEARLY SHOWN
>>FROM MANY VERSES OF THE QUR'AN.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE QUR'AN SAYS:
>>
>>"FOR MUSLIM MEN AND WOMEN, --
>>FOR BELIEVING MEN AND WOMEN,
>>FOR DEVOUT MEN AND WOMEN,
>>FOR TRUE MEN AND WOMEN,
>>FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE PATIENT AND CONSTANT,
>>FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO HUMBLE THEMSELVES,
>>FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO GIVE IN CHARITY,
>>FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO FAST (AND DENY THEMSELVES),
>>FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO GUARD THEIR CHASTITY,
>>AND FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ENGAGE MUCH IN GOD'S PRAISE --
>>FOR THEM HAS GOD PREPARED FORGIVENESS AND A GREAT REWARD."
>>
>>[QUR'AN 33:35, ABDULLAH YUSUF ALI'S TRANSLATION]
>>
>>THERE ARE OTHER QUOTES TOO, BUT I THINK THE ABOVE QUOTE SHOWS THAT MEN
>>AND WOMEN ARE SPIRITUAL EQUALS (AND THUS, THAT WOMEN HAVE SOULS JUST AS
>>MEN DO) VERY CLEARLY.

>NO, IT DOES NOT. IT IMPLIES THAT THEY HAVE SOULS, BUT IT DOES NOT SAY THEY

ONE MUST APPROACH THE QUR'AN WITH INTELLIGENCE.  ANY THINKING
