So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is 
if it contradicts the Quran  What if it relates to something 
that isnt explicitly spelled out in the Quran 
 
Also the Quran wasnt written down during the life of Muhammed 
either  It wasnt long after but 20 years or so is still long 
enough to shift a few verses around
