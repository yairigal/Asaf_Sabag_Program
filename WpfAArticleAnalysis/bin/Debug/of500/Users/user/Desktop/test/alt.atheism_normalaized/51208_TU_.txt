 HERE'S THE (MAIN) PROBLEM. THE SCENARIO YOU OUTLINE IS REASONABLY 
CONSISTENT, BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH NOT ONLY DOES
NOT SUPPORT IT, BUT INDICATES SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT. THE EARTH, BY
LATEST ESTIMATES, IS ABOUT 4.6 BILLION YEARS OLD, AND HAS HAD LIFE FOR
ABOUT 3.5 BILLION OF THOSE YEARS. HUMANS HAVE ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR (AT
MOST) ABOUT 200,000 YEARS. BUT, THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE INIDCATES THAT LIFE
HAS BEEN CHANGING AND EVOLVING, AND, IN FACT, DISEASE-RIDDEN, LONG BEFORE
THERE WERE PEOPLE. (YES, THERE ARE FOSSILS THAT SHOW SIGNS OF DISEASE...
MOSTLY BONE DISORDERS, OF COURSE, BUT THERE ARE SOME.) HECK, NOT JUST
FOSSIL EVIDENCE, BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN FROM GENETIC STUDY SHOWS
THAT DISEASE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. IF HUMAN SIN WAS WHAT
BROUGHT ABOUT DISEASE (AT LEAST, INDIRECTLY, THOUGH NECESSARILY) THEN
HOW COULD IT EXIST BEFORE HUMANS?

 UH... I KNOW OF MANY EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS, WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT
BIOLOGY THAN YOU CLAIM TO, WHO WILL STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS. THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE HUMAN GENETIC CODE (OR ANY OTHER) 'STARTED OFF'
IN PERFECT CONDITION. IT SEEMS TO ADAPT TO ITS ENVIONMENT, IN A
COLLECTIVE SENSE. I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU MEAN BY 'THE
DEGENERATION OF THE GENETIC CODE'.

 UMM. NAH, WE SEEM TO DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ADAPTING TO VIRUSES AND
BACTERIA, AND THEY TO US. ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MICROLIFE IS
HARMFUL TO HUMANS... AND THAT SMALL PERCENTAGE SEEMS TO BE REASONALBY
CONSTANT IN SIZE, BUT THE RANKS KEEP CHANGING. FOR EXAMPLE, BUBONIC
