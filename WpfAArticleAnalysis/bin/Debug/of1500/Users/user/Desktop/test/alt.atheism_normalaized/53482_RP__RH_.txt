For example I would claim that the recent assassination of four 
catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA 
was probably religously motivated

What would you call is when someone writes The killings in NI  
are not religously motivated 
 
Id say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge and by 
misguided patriotism  Otherwise Id have to wonder how come mainland 
catholics are not killed by mainland protestants and southern 
catholics are not killed by southern protestants and so on  Take away 
all plausible causes bar religion and the violence diminishes markedly 
Gee why is that

Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland 
into a country that has a particular church written into its  
constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated 
by that Church I fail to see why the word past is appropriate 
 
The country also has a different official language written in its 
constitution and vice versa   maybe theyre motivated by a love of  
Irish poetry  Your argument is fallacious jon 
 
For what its worth I agree with all that you say about Ireland above  
and more
