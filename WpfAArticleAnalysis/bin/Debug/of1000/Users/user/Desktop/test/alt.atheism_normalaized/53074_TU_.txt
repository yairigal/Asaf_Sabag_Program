#>IS GOOD LOGIC *BETTER* THAN BAD?  IS GOOD SCIENCE BETTER THAN BAD?  
#
#	BY DEFINITION.

TRUE ENOUGH.  O.K., IN THE UNIVERSE WE HAVE TODAY, WHICH IS BETTER, A SCIENCE

WHICH PREDICTS THAT SONIC THE HEDGEHOG WILL RECORD AN ALBUM WITH ELVIS ON
A CERTAIN DATE, AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN?  CAN THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
BE CALLED OBJECTIVE, OR IS IT A MATTER OF OPINION?
