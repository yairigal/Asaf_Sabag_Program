 Crap crap crap crap crap  A definition of any type of phobe comes from 
 phobia = an irrational fear of  Hence a homophobe not only in ACT UP meetings 
 the word is apparently in general use now  Or perhaps it isnt in the bible   
 Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak 
  
 Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider  Does an 
 agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space  Do you 
 understand English 
  
 Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it  They will do their best 
 to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or 
 run away  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes  People 
 who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or 
 cause them or themselves violence

What are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely 
parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful

 Monty Python song  Every sperm is sacred  And if as *you*
