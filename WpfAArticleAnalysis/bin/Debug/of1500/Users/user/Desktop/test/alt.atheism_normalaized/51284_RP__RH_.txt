   Yesterday I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the 
University of New Hampshire Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  
honorary head of the American Humanist Association Vonnegut is 
an atheist and so was Asimov Before Asimovs funeral Vonnegut stood up 
and said about Asimov Hes in heaven now which ignited uproarious  
laughter in the room from the people he was speaking to around the time 
of the funeral 
 
	 Its the funniest thing I could have possibly said 
to a room full of humanists Vonnegut said at yesterdays lecture  
 
         If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university I highly recommend 
going to see him even if youve never read any of his novels In my opinion 
hes the greatest living humorist greatest living humanist humorist as well 
 
 
   Peace
