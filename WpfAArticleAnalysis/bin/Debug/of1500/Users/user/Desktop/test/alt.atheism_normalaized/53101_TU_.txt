WHERE DID I SAY THAT YOU WERE A CHURCH MEMBER?   I JUST SAID
THAT PEOPLE WHO BUY YOUR KIND OF ARGUMENTS FINISH UP AS CHURCH
MEMBERS.   THERE'S STILL TIME.

YOU UNDERVALUE YOURSELF, FRANK.   YOU'RE ONE OF THE SLICKEST
SALESMEN I'VE SEEN.

NOT, OF COURSE, THE GREATEST SALESMAN IN THE WORLD.   THAT WAS
JESUS, WASN'T IT?
