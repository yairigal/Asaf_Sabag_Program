So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other 
beings mimics theirs  And how much emphasis do you place on intelligence 
Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they 
dont  Are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because 
most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do
