Anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a lie  As for 
people being able to tell if he was a liar well weve had grifters and 
charlatans since the beginning of civilization  If David Copperfield had 
been the Messiah I bet he could have found plenty of believers   
Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer and he wasnt the 
first to be witnessed  What sets him apart

Rubbish  Nations have followed crazies liars psychopaths and  
megalomaniacs throughout history  Hitler Tojo Mussolini Khomeini 
Qadaffi Stalin Papa Doc and Nixon come to mindall from this century 
Koresh is a nonissue

Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course  There are flaws in your 
logic everywhere  And as Im sure others will tell you read the FAQ

Of course you have to believe the Bible first  Just because something is 
written in the Bible does not mean it is true and the age of that tome plus 
the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible  So if you 
do quote from the Bible in the future try to back up that quote with  
supporting evidence  Otherwise you will get flamed mercilessly
