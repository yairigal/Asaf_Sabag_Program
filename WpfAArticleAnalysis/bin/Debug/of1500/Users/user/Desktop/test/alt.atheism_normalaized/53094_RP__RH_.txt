1  Did you read the FAQs 
 
2  If NO Read the FAQs 
 
3  IF YES you wouldnt have posted such drivel  The Lord Liar 
    or Lunatic argument is a false trilemma  Even if you disprove 
    Liar and Lunatic which you havent you have not eliminated 
    the other possibilities such as Mistaken Misdirected or 
    Misunderstood  You have arbitrarily set up three and only 
    three possibilities without considering others 
 
4  Read a good book on rhetoric and critical thinking  If 
    you think the Lord Liar or Lunatic discussion is an 
    example of a good argument you are in need of learning 
 
5  Read the FAQs again especially Constructing a Logical 
    Argument 
 
Ignore these instructions at your peril  Disobeying them 
leaves you open for righteous flaming
