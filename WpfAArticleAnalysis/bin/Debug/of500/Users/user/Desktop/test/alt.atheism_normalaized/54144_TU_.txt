WELL, YES, BUT THAT BELONGS IN THE OTHER GROUP, THERE IS A INTERPRETATION
FOUND FOR EVERYTHING. HOWEVER, ALLOWING ANY FORM OF INTERPRETATION REDUCES
THE INFORMATION OF THE TEXT SO INTERPRTETED TO ZERO.
 
BY THE WAY, I HAVE CHECKED THE QUOTE AND I THINK THE LINES PRECEDING THOSE
QUOTED ABOVE ARE MORE INTERESTING:
 
   21:32 WHERE MOUNTAINS ARE SET ON EARTH IN ORDER TO IMMOBILIZE THE EARTH.
   21:33 WHERE THE SKIES (HEAVENS?) ARE REFERRED TO AS WELL SUPPORTED.
 
THE LINES GIVEN ABOVE ARE  21:34 AFTER MY EDITION.
 
 
>MAYBE THIS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE ABOVE....?  IT'S JUST A POSSIBILITY.
>
>>AND THAT THE SUN TRAVELS IN AN ORBIT WITHOUT SAYING THAT EARTH DOES, TOO,
>>SOUNDS GEOCENTRIC TO ME.
>
>I WILL SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS.
>
>BUT IT IS STILL NOT GEOCENTRIC.
>
 
THAT SUN AND MOON MOVE AND THE EARTH IS IMMOBILE SOUNDS GEOCENTRIC TO ME.
