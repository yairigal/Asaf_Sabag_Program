I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why 
I intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can 
walk anywhere and I mean *anywhere* at any time of day or night and not 
feel uneasy even if ones from an ethnic minority as I was 
 
Clues for Bobby why do I bother i Tokyo is a city and inner Tokyo 
is an inner city ii there is a negligible level of violent crime and 
a street murder will be a lead item on *national* TV news iii the 
population is almost universally atheistic 
 
Next time I go for a stroll around Beirut at night Ill let you know how 
it compares
