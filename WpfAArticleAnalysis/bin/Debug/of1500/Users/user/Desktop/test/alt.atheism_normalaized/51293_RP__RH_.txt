	This posts contains too many fallacies to respond too 
 
	1 The abolishment of divinity requires the elimination of  
freewill  
 
	You have not shown this You have not even attempted to However 
the existance of an Omniscience being does eliminate freewill in mortals* 
 
	* Posted over five months ago No one has been able to refute it  
nor give any reasonable reasons against it 
 
 
 
 
       Satan and the Angels do not have freewill   
        They do what god tells them to do
