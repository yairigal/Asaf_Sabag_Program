To put it as simply as possible *I am not a Muslim* I do not 
 accept the charge of apostacy because I have never in my adult life 
 affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be 
 said to have apostasized from  The Islam I know states clearly that 
 there can be no coercion in matters of religion  The many Muslims 
 I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their 
 faith *purely by virtue of birth* and that a person who freely chose 
 not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death

God Satan Paradise and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth 
 year when I quite abruptly lost my faith  and afterwards to 
 prove my newfound atheism I bought myself a rather tasteless ham 
 sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of 
 the swine  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down  From that 
 day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person
