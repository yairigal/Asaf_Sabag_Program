ONLY THOSE YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY READ?  SORRY, BUT THE IRONY REMAINS.

>I REITERATE FOR THE NTH TIME ALSO THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH K'S FATWA,

SO ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE FATWA, AND APPARENTLY DON'T THINK
RUSHDIE SHOULD BE KILLED FOR HIS BOOK, YET YOU THINK HE IS NOT DUE
SYMPATHY FOR BEING BEING UNDER THIS THREAT.  FURTHERMORE YOU BASE THIS
REACTION SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT HE WROTE ABOUT A PARTICULAR
WELL-KNOWN STORY WHICH -- IF TRUE -- MIGHT REFLECT POORLY ON THE
ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF YOUR RELIGION.  YET, THIS OPINION IS FORMED WITHOUT
RECOURSE TO ACTUALLY LOOKING TO SEE HOW THE STORY IS USED IN CONTEXT,
ACCEPTING AT FACE VALUE THE WIDESPREAD PROPAGANDA ON JUST WHAT THIS
BOOK CONTAINS AND WHAT THE AUTHOR'S MOTIVATIONS ARE.  AND THEN YOU
COME FORWARD AND RECOMMEND ANOTHER BOOK WHICH TOUCHES ON (PRESUMABLY
"PLAYS WITH") RELIGIOUS/HISTORICAL MATERIAL BECAUSE YOU FIND ITS
OVERALL PRESENTATION NEUTRAL!
