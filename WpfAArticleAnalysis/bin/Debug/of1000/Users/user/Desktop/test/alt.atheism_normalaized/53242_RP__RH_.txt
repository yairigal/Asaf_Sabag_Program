Thats a mighty bold assertion Care to prove it 
 
Theories judged to be simple by people  Predictions judged to 
be accurate by people   These are value judgements and science doesnt  
work without them

I never said it is useful or useless I say it is an accurate description 
of what occurs people or no people values or no values 
 
Accurate in whose opinion  Yours  Is the fact that it seems to be an  
accurate description which applies to everyone of *no* relevance   
 
> One assumes objective reality one doesnt know it   
 
But one can get supporting evidence from the fact that the reality behaves 
the same way in the same situation every time that situaton occurs  
 
The same can not be said of morals 
 
Confidently asserted falsehood  On the one hand people can demonstrate  
that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of  
the sun  People will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less  
often than they will disagree if you say evolution or for that matter QM or 
relativity is an accurate description of observed phenomena  On the 
other hand even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement it remains 
reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that QM etc is an accurate  
description of observed phenomena
