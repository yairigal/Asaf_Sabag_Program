I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M PREACHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO ANSWER PEOPLE'S 
QUESTIONS AND TALKING ABOUT MY RELIGION, MY BELIEFS.
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT I POST, I DON'T DO IT WITH THE INTENT OF CONVERTING 
ANYONE.  I DON'T EXPECT FOR THE ATHEISTS IN THIS NEWSGROUP TO TAKE WHAT I 
SAY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IF THEY SO WISH.
I JUST STATE WHAT I BELEVE, THEY ASK ME HOW I BELIEVEIT AND WHY AND WE ALL 
GO ON. 
IF THAT'S PREACHING, THEN I'M SOORY AND I'LL GET OFF THE SOAPBOX.

TAMMY
