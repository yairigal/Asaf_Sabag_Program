If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I  
would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong  My  
basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current legalities  My basis 
is surprise surprise on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences for 
lack of a better way to put it to certain things  Yes thats vague and the 
only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans  
are similarly made Yes that falls into the trap of creation and why follow  
the Bible  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness  
love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt hatred 
disrespect cowardness and dishonesty  No I havent been everywhere and  
seen everyone but according to my thesis I dont have to since I hold that 
we were all created similarly  If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis just say 
so and Ill both work out what I can and punt to fellow theists
