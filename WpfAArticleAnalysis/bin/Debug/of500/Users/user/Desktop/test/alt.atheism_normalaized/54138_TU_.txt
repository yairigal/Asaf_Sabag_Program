IT HAS. THERE IS A GUY RUNNING AROUND IN SWITZERLAND WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE
BEEN CONCEIVED SIMILARLY. HIS MOTHER SAYS THE SAME. HIS FATHER IS SAID TO
BE A BIT SURPRISED.
 
BUT ANYWAY, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MESSIAHS, AND MANY HAVE HAD A SIMILAR
STORY ABOUT THEIR BIRTH. OR THEIR DEATH. A LIST OF MESSIAHS COULD BE QUITE
INTERESTING.

I WOULD WONDER WHY AN OMNIPOTENT GOD PULLS SUCH STUNTS INSTEAD OF PROVIDING
EVIDENCE FOR EVERYONE TO CHECK. AND THE WHOLE QUESTION IS ABSURD.
 
WOULDN'T YOU FEEL BAD IF YOU'D FIND OUT THAT STONES ARE SENTIENT, AND THAT
YOU HAVE STEPPED ON THEM ALL YOUR LIFE? AND WOULDN'T YOU FEEL BAD WHEN YOU'D
SEE THE PROOF THAT JESUS WAS JUST A PLOT OF SATAN?

THE ARGUMENT IS A FALLACY. IT IS LIKE "THANKS FOR READING THIS FAR" ON THE END
OF A LETTER. MOST RELIGIONS CLAIM THAT THEY WON'T FIZZLE BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN
SOME ETERNAL TRUTH. SO DOES CHRISTIANITY. SINCE THERE ARE OLD RELIGIONS IT IS
NO WONDER TO FIND OLD RELIGIONS THAT HAVE IT THAT THEY WOULD LAST.
