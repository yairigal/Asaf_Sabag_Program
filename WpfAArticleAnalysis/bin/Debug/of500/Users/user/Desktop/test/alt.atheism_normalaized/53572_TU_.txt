THIS IS AN INTERESTING NOTION -- AND ONE I'M SCARED OF. IN MY
CASE I'M A FINNISH CITIZEN, I LIVE IN USA, AND I HAVE TO CONFORM
TO THE US LAWS. HOWEVER, THE FINNISH GOVERNMENT IS NOT ACTIVELY
CHECKING OUT WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS COUNTRY, IN OTHER WORDS CHECKING
OUT IF I CONFORM TO THE FINNISH LAWS.

HOWEVER, ISLAMIC LAW SEEMS TO BE A 'CURSE' THAT IS FOLLOWING YOU
EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. SHADES OF 1984, EH?

CHEERS,
KENT
