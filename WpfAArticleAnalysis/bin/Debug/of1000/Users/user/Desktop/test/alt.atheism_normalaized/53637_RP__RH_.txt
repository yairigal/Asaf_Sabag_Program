Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged 
more than once When I did it you said good question and did not 
address it 
 
Ive addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless 
to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with  
Eric Rescorla   
 
>b Theres little point in responding the same points everywhere I do 
>    my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply 
  
You still repeat that point 
 
I do Curious since I believe that was the first time Ive ever made it 
Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability 
to understand you ask me the same question Ill give you the same 
answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true  I 
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is 
making the same points and Im pushed for time then I try to respond what I  
believe are the strongest formulations of those points  If that doesnt 
include your post tough this is USENET and life is tough all over

You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others You appear 
with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning 
again 
 
Ive only debated this issue twice in aa and occasionally in ta  The 
first was in response to Simon Clippingdales positive assertion that 
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals 
are relative  It doesnt   Now Simon has dropped out of the debate 
for some time I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored 
with the topic  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty  Do you  
 
>d I cant always understand what you say 
  
Neither cant I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other 
side means 
 
Usually one does  Usually youre clear but sometimes you arent  
and I ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight  
and I feel that Im debating against line noise  Sometimes I get tired and  
sometimes I have other things Id rather do  Again this is USENET and 
life is tough all over  Youre going to have to deal with it 
 
>e Youre starting to get personally insulting I may not even put your name 
>    in the hat in future 
 
Thats supposed to be a threat 
 
No thats a simple statement and an assertion that I am not answerable 
to those who offer me baseless insults  For example those who accuse me  
of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that I dont answer 
their questions   
 
>Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there 
>If only everything would be so easy 
> 
>What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there 
>Because to all intents and purposes it *is* there 
> We had that argument For one your claim that everyone senses it 
is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often 
And then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it 
is there unless evidence against it has been found 
 
I have no problem with the second statement  I have provided an 
argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable  the 
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered 
by some other people too essentially that people disagree about 
fuzzy concepts such as Freedom  Its a good point and Im thinking 
about it 
  
Your trick is to say I feel A is not right and so do many I know 
therefore A is absolutely right It neglects the possibility that 
these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process 
restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject 
of that process In other words refutes it You make the ontological 
claim you have to prove it 
 
Nonsense  My trick is to say  I feel that A is better than B and so  
does almost any disinterested person I ask  Best evidence is therefore  
that A really is better than B subject to the assumption that we 
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and 
that the resulting system of values is selfconsistent 
 
Now get this  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model 
in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model It 
may or may not correspond to something true  It is nonetheless a useful 
assumption  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  
trick to wit 
 
I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested
