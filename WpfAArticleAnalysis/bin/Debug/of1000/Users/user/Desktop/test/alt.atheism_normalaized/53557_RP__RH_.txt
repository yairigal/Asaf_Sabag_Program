QUOTE 
 
The fundamentalists leap up and down in apoplectic rage and joy  Their  
worst fantasies are vindicated and therefore or so they like to think  
their entire theology and sociopolitical agenda is too  Meanwhile teenage 
misanthropes and social misfits murder their enemies classmates families 
friends even complete strangers all because they read one of Anton LaVeys 
cooks or listened to one too many ACDC records  The bornagains are ready 
to burn again and not just books this time 
 
 
 
REVIEWETTE The Book of the SubGenius JR Dobbs  the SubGenius Foundation 
ISBN 0671638106 Simon  Schuster 
 
Described by Rolling Stone as A sick masterpiece for those who can still 
laugh at the fact that nothing is funny anymore  The official Bible of the 
SubGenius Church containing the sacred teachings of JR Bob Dobbs  
Instant answers to everything causes catalytic brain cell loss in seconds 
the secret of total slack how to relax in the safety of your delusions and 
pull the wool over your own eyes nuclear doom and other things to laugh at 
 
QUOTE 
 
He has been known to answer questions concerning universal truths with  
screams  With suggestive silence  By peeing down his pants leg  His most 
famous sermon was of cosmic simplicity Bob standing on the stage with his 
hands in his pockets smoking looking around and saying nothing  Heated 
arguments still rage among the monks often erupting into fatal duels as 
towhether the Master consulted his wristwatch during this divine period of 
Grace
