As I understand things this is just a matter of perspective If you are 
on the outside looking in it appears that nothing can ever enter the 
black hole as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow 
and never gets there However if you are on the object looking out you 
get an entirely different view As you look out you will see the universe 
speed up and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of 
the universe without
