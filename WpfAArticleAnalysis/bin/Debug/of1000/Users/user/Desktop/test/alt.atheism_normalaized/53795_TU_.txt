#[WITH MY HIGHLIGHTS - SC]

#> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#> NOT EVIDENCE FOR BUG, AND NEITHER IS IT EVIDENCE FOR BENEFACTOR. NOR
#> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#> IS TRUE TO SAY THAT THIS HYPOTHETICAL UNIVERSE APPEARS EXACTLY AS

#
#THIS IS STILL CONTRADICTORY. IT REDUCES TO
#
#  (1): ALTERIAN DOSH ARRIVING IN MY ACCOUNT IS DUE TO [BENEFACTOR OR BUG].
#
#  (2): THIS IS NOT EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR], NEITHER IS IT EVIDENCE FOR
#       [BUG] (MEANING THAT IT DOESN'T LEND MORE WEIGHT TO ONE THAN TO THE
#       OTHER)
#
#  (3): THEREFORE NO EVIDENCE CAN EXIST FOR [BENEFACTOR] AND NO EVIDENCE
#       CAN EXIST FOR [BUG].
#
#BUT (3) RELIES ON A SHIFT IN MEANING FROM (2). WHEN YOU SAY (PARAPHRASED)
#IN (2) THAT THIS IS NOT "EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR]", FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT YOU
#MEAN IS THAT IT'S NO *MORE* EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR] THAN IT IS FOR [BUG].

YES, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

#IN (3), HOWEVER, YOU'VE SHIFTED THE MEANING OF "EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR]"
#SO THAT IT NOW MEANS `ABSOLUTE' "EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR]" RATHER THAN
#`RELATIVE' "EVIDENCE FOR [BENEFACTOR]" W.R.T. [BUG].

NOT REALLY, I MEANT EVIDENCE THAT WOULD TEND TO ONE OVER THE OTHER.  I
THINK THIS IS JUST A COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM.   WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY,
IN MY CLUMSY WAY, IS THAT WHILE I BUY YOUR THEORY AS FAR AS IT RELATES
TO THEISM MAKING PREDICTIONS (PRAYER, YOUR 'RAPTURE' EXAMPLE), I DON'T
BUY YOUR USE OF OCCAM'S RAZOR IN ALL CASES WHERE A=0.

IN MY EXAMPLE, ONE COULDN'T DISMISS
[BENEFACTOR] OR [BUG] ON THE GROUNDS OF SIMPLICITY - ONE OF THESE IS NECESSARY
TO EXPLAIN THE DOSH.  I BROUGHT UP THE 'ONE-BY-ONE DISMISSAL' PROCESS TO
SHOW THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO DO SO.  FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN THIS
POST, IT SEEMS YOU AGREE, AND WE'RE TALKING AT CROSS-PURPOSES.

#(3) IS STILL IN CONTRADICTION TO (1).
#
#SOME SUMS MAY HELP. WITH B = BENEFACTOR, B = BUG, D = DOSH ARRIVES IN ACCOUNT:
#
#  (1) IMPLIES  P(B+B | D) = 1
#
#ASSUMING THAT P(BB | D) = 0, SO IT'S EITHER THE BENEFACTOR *OR* A BUG
#WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE IF THE BUCKS ARRIVE, BUT NOT BOTH, THEN
#
#   P(B+B | D)   =   P(B | D) + P(B | D)
#
#SO
#
#   P(B | D) + P(B | D)  =  1
#
#BUT (3) IMPLIES THAT
#
#   P(B | D)  =  0  AND  P(B | D)  =  0.

NO, THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT.  P(B | D) = 0.5 AND P(B | D) = 0.5, WITH
NECESSARILY NO NEW OBSERVATION (WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE DOSH) TO CHANGE
THOSE ESTIMATES.  I WAS TRYING TO SAY (AGAIN, IN MY CLUMSY WAY) THAT
IT WOULD BE _WRONG_ TO ASSIGN 0 PROBABILITY TO EITHER OF THESE.  AND THAT'S
PRECISELY WHAT USE OF THE RAZOR DOES IN THE CASE OF GODS - GODS ARE
ONE CLASS OF HYPOTHESIS (THERE ARE MANY OTHERS) BELONGING TO A SET OF
HYPOTHESES _ONE_OF_WHICH_ IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING WHICH OTHERWISE 
WOULD _NOT_ BE SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED.  IT CAN BE THROWN OUT OR
RETAINED ON GROUNDS OF NON-RATIONAL PREFERENCE, NOT OF SCIENCE OR STATISTICS.   
ALTERNATIVELY,
