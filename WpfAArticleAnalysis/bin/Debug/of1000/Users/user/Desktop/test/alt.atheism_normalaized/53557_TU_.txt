REVIEWETTE: "LOOMPANICS' GREATEST HITS"
ISBN 1-55950-031-X (LOOMPANICS)

A SELECTION OF ARTICLES PICKED FROM THE BOOKS IN LOOMPANICS' CATALOGUE.  
SUBJECTS INCLUDE:

 * CHRISTIAN DISPENSATIONALISM -- HOW RIGHT-WING CHRISTIANS ENCOURAGED 
   THE COLD WAR
 * SATANIC CHILD ABUSE MYTHS
 * RELIGION AND CENSORSHIP
 
PLUS LOTS OF ANARCHIST AND LIBERTARIAN STUFF, SITUATIONISM, COMPUTERS AND 
PRIVACY, AND SO ON.  GUARANTEED TO CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE ARTICLE THAT'LL 
OFFEND YOU -- LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTERVIEW WITH BRADLEY R. SMITH, THE 
HOLOCAUST REVISIONIST.  A GOOD SAMPLING OF STUFF IN A COFFEE TABLE BOOK.  (OF
COURSE, WHETHER YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS SORT OF STUFF LYING AROUND ON YOUR
COFFEE TABLE IS ANOTHER MATTER.)

QUOTE:

"THE FUNDAMENTALISTS LEAP UP AND DOWN IN APOPLECTIC RAGE AND JOY.  THEIR 
WORST FANTASIES ARE VINDICATED, AND THEREFORE (OR SO THEY LIKE TO THINK), 
THEIR ENTIRE THEOLOGY AND SOCIO-POLITICAL AGENDA IS TOO.  MEANWHILE, TEEN-AGE
MISANTHROPES AND SOCIAL MISFITS MURDER THEIR ENEMIES, CLASSMATES, FAMILIES,
FRIENDS, EVEN COMPLETE STRANGERS, ALL BECAUSE THEY READ ONE OF ANTON LAVEY'S
COOKS OR LISTENED TO ONE TOO MANY AC/DC RECORDS.  THE BORN-AGAINS ARE READY
TO BURN AGAIN, AND NOT JUST BOOKS THIS TIME."

REVIEWETTE: "THE BOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS", J.R. DOBBS & THE SUBGENIUS FOUNDATION
ISBN 0-671-63810-6 (SIMON & SCHUSTER)

SUBGENIUS CHURCH, CONTAINING THE SACRED TEACHINGS OF J.R. "BOB" DOBBS. 
INSTANT ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING; CAUSES CATALYTIC BRAIN CELL LOSS IN SECONDS;
THE SECRET OF TOTAL SLACK; HOW TO RELAX IN THE SAFETY OF YOUR DELUSIONS AND
PULL THE WOOL OVER YOUR OWN EYES; NUCLEAR DOOM AND OTHER THINGS TO LAUGH AT.

QUOTE:

"HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCERNING UNIVERSAL TRUTHS WITH 
SCREAMS.  WITH SUGGESTIVE SILENCE.  BY PEEING DOWN HIS PANTS LEG.  HIS MOST
FAMOUS SERMON WAS OF COSMIC SIMPLICITY: "BOB" STANDING ON THE STAGE WITH HIS
HANDS IN HIS POCKETS, SMOKING, LOOKING AROUND AND SAYING NOTHING.  HEATED
ARGUMENTS STILL RAGE AMONG THE MONKS, OFTEN ERUPTING INTO FATAL DUELS, AS
TOWHETHER THE MASTER CONSULTED HIS WRISTWATCH DURING THIS DIVINE PERIOD OF
GRACE."

ISBN 0-671-64260-X (SIMON & SCHUSTER)

AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WIERD ORGANIZATIONS YOU CAN CONTACT BY MAIL.  SPACE 
JESUSES, CHRISTIAN VS CHRISTIAN, UFO CONTACTEES, NEW AGE SAPS, CREATIONISTS,
FLAT EARTHERS, WHITE SUPREMACIST CHURCHES, PLUS (YAWN) CSICOP, SCEPTICAL
ENQUIRER AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  NOT JUST A LIST OF ADDRESSES, THOUGH, AS EACH
KOOK GROUP IS RUTHLESSLY MOCKED AND RIDICULED WITH SARCASTIC GLEE.  IF YOU
LIKE ALT.ATHEISM'S FLAME WARS, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.  MADE ME LAUGH UNTIL
MY STOMACH ACHED.  REVISED EDITION DUE SOME TIME IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO.

SAMPLE ENTRY:

   ENTERTAINING DEMONS UNAWARES
   SOUTHWEST RADIO CHURCH
   PO BOX 1144
   OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73101

   "YOUR WATCHMAN ON THE WALL."  ANOTHER FLAGELLATING, GENUFLECTING 
   FUNDAMENTALIST OUTFIT.  THEIR BOOKLET "ENTERTAINING DEMONS UNAWARES"
   EXPOSES THE STAR WARS / E.T. / DUNGEONS & DRAGONS / SATURDAY MORNING
   CARTOON / SATANIC CONNECTION IN HORRIFYING DETAIL.  LEFT OUT SMURFS,
   THOUGH! I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE BIT ABOUT WONDER WOMAN'S ANTICHRIST ORIGINS.
   KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU SEND FOR ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE, YOU'LL BE
   ON THEIR MAILING LIST FOR LIFE.

REVIEWETTE: "THE ABOLITION OF WORK", BOB BLACK
ISBN 0-915179-41-5 (LOOMPANICS)

A SELECTION OF BOB BLACK'S PAINFULLY WITTY AND INTELLIGENT ANARCHIST TRACTS
COLLECTED INTO BOOK FORM.  IF I WERE THIS GOOD I'D BE INSUFFERABLE.(*) 
PROBABLY THE ONLY THOUGHT-PROVOKING POLITICAL BOOK THAT'S FUN TO READ.

QUOTE:

"BABBLE ABOUT 'THE WAGES OF SIN' SERVES TO COVER UP 'THE SIN OF WAGES'.  WE
WANT RIGHTS, NOT RITES -- SEX, NOT SECTS.  ONLY EROS AND ERIS BELONG IN OUR
PANTHEON.  SURELY THE NAZARENE NECROPHILE HAS HAD HIS REVENGE BY NOW. 
REMEMBER, PAIN IS JUST GOD'S WAY OF HURTING YOU."
