Right on Jon  Who cares who or whose as long as it works for the individual 
But dont try to impose those beliefs on us or our children  I would add the 
wellfunded group tries also to purge science to deny children access to great 
wonders and skills  And how about the kids born to creationists  What a 
burden with which to begin adult life  It must be a cruel awakening for those 
who finally see the light provided it is possible to escape from the depths of 
this type of ignorance
