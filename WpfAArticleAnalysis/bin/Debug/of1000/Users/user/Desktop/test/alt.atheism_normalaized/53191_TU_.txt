THEN NOT MURDERING WOULD HAVE NO MORAL SIGNIFICANCE, SINCE THERE
WOULD BE NOTHING VOLUNTARY ABOUT IT.

YOU ARE STARTING TO GET THE POINT.   MIMICRY IS NOT NECESSARILY THE 
SAME AS THE ACTION BEING IMITATED.   A PARROT SAYING "PRETTY POLLY" 
ISN'T NECESSARILY COMMENTING ON THE PULCHRITUDE OF POLLY.

|> AND, HOW MUCH EMPHASIS DO YOU PLACE ON INTELLIGENCE?

SEE ABOVE.

|> ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES COULD KILL EACH OTHER ARBITARILY, BUT 
|> THEY DON'T.

THEY DO.   I AND OTHER POSTERS HAVE GIVEN YOU MANY EXAMPLES OF EXACTLY
THIS, BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A VERY SHORT MEMORY.

|> ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT THIS ISN'T AN ACT OF MORALITY BECAUSE
|> MOST ANIMALS AREN'T INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO THINK LIKE WE DO?

I'M SAYING:

	"THERE MUST BE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ORGANISM - IT'S NOT 
	JUST PEOPLE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT - CAN CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES."

IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE POSTING YOU ARE REPLYING TO.

JON.
