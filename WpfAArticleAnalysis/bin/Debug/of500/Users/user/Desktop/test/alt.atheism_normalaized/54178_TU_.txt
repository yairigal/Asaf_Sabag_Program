WHILE I'LL AGREE THAT THESE ARE GENERALLY HELD TO BE "GOOD THINGS", I
QUESTION WHETHER THEY COME VERY CLOSE TO BEING OBJECTIVE VALUES.
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER EACH HAS BEEN
VIEWED AS BEING UNDESIRABLE.  I DOUBT YOU COULD EVEN COME UP WITH
ANYTHING THAT COULD BE SAID TO BE UNIVERSALLY "GOOD" OR "BAD".

AND WHEN I REFERRED TO "THE TRUTH" I WAS USING THE TERM
HYPOTHETICALLY, REALIZING FULL WELL THAT THERE MAY NOT EVEN BE SUCH A
THING.

TRUE ENOUGH.  BUT THEY CANNOT BE SAID TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN
PERSONAL MORALS.  ONE THING NOTABLY LACKING IN MOST EXTREMISTS IS ANY
SENSE OF _PERSONAL_ ACCOUNTABILITY - THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ANY
SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR IS INVARIABLY SOME "HIGHER AUTHORITY"
(AKA, ABSOLUTE MORAL TRUTH).
