To repeat what I had said in an earlier post  Evolution is 
a theory  If you accept it as fact then that is faith and 
not much different from religion  If you accept it as the 
theory it is then there is 0 religion involved and it  
can be quite useful in the realm of science 
 
Simply put evolutioncreation when each is looked at 
properly  theoryassertion not factfiction  is a  
specific example of exactly what separates soft athiesm  
and science from religion
