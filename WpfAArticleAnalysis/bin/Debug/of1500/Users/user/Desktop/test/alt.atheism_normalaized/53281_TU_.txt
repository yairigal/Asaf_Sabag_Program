>>JIM HOGAN QUIPS:

>>... (SUMMARY OF JIM'S STUFF)

>>JIM, I'M AFRAID _YOU'VE_ MISSED THE POINT.

>>>THUS, I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT  ATHEISTS HAVE A LOT
>>MORE UP THEIR SLEEVE THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED.

>>NAH.  I WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT ATHEISM TO SEE HOW LITTLE ATHEISTS
>>HAVE UP THEIR SLEEVES.  WHATEVER I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED IS ACTUALLY QUITE
>>MEAGER.  IF YOU WANT I'LL SEND THEM YOUR ADDRESS TO LEARN LESS ABOUT YOUR
>>FAITH.

>FAITH?

YEAH, DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO READ THE FAQ, ETC. AND ACTUALLY ACCEPT HARD

>>>THE IDEA OF A GOD?  ....

>>>I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND NOW.

>>YES, JIM.  I DO UNDERSTAND NOW.  THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING SOME HEALTHY SARCASM

>WHISPERING IN YOUR EAR HERE)  THEY'RE ALL DELUSIONAL!

JIM,

SORRY I CAN'T PITY YOU, JIM.  AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE THESE FEELINGS OF
DENIAL ABOUT THE FAITH YOU NEED TO GET BY.  OH WELL, JUST PRETEND THAT IT WILL
ALL END HAPPILY EVER AFTER ANYWAY.  MAYBE IF YOU START A NEW NEWSGROUP,
ALT.ATHEIST.HARD, YOU WON'T BE BUMMIN' SO MUCH?

>GOOD JOB, JIM.

>BYE, BAKE.


>>[MORE SLIM-JIM (TM) DELETED]

>BYE, BAKE!
>BYE, BYE!

BYE-BYE, BIG JIM.  DON'T FORGET YOUR FLINTSTONE'S CHEWABLES!  :)
