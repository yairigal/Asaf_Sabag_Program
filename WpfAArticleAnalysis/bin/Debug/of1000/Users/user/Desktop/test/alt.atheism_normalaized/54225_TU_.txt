JAMES FELDER (SPBACH@LERC.NASA.GOV) WROTE:

: ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEIR WAS A PHYSICAL ADAM AND EVE, AND THAT ALL HUMANS ARE DIRECT DECENDENTS OF ONLY THESE TWO HUMAN BEINGS.?  THEN WHO WERE CAIN AND ABLE'S WIVES?  COULDN'T BE THEIR SISTERS, BECAUSE A&E DIDN'T HAVE DAUGHTERS.  WERE THEY NON-HUMANS?

OKAY ALL HUMANS ARE DIRECT DESCENDENTS OF OF A BUNCH OF HOPEFUL
MONSTERS. THE HUMAN RACE DIDN'T EVOLVE FROM ONE SET PARENTS, BUT FROM
THOUSANDS. DO YOU REALLY BASE YOUR ATHEIST ON -THIS-?

: CONSIDERING THAT SOMETHING LIKE 4 OUT OF 5 HUMANS ON THIS PLANET DON'T KNOW INSTINCTIVELY THAT THE CHRISTIAN GOD EXIST, THE CLAIM OF INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HOLD MUCH WATER.  OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE 4 BILLION NON-CHRISTIANS IN THE WORLD MUST FIGHT THIS INSTINCTIVE URGE TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD AND JC.

DID I SAY THAT PEOPLE WERE CHRISTIANS BY NATURE OR DID I SAY THAT
CHRISTIANS HOLD THAT EVERYONE KNOWS OF THE GOD THE CHRISTIANS WORSHIP.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE DISTINCTION OBVIOUS, SORRY. READ MY POST
AGAIN AND SEE WHAT I -REALLY- SAID; FROM WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN, I THINK
YOU ARE JUST BEING AGUMENTATIVE. ALSO YOUR WORD-WRAP IS SCREWED UP OR
YOU NEED TO SHIFT TO 80 COLUMNS TEXT ...
