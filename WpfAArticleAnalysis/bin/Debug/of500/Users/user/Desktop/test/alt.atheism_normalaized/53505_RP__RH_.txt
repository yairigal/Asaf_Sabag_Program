As I understand that number is deceptive  The reason is that the money 
cost was in nonoil sales for the most part  Iraq still is not allowed 
to sell oil or do many of the things under the initial sanctions but 
is still surviving

Of the 93 I have heard figures closer to 80 but I wont quibble your 
figures most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by 
enemy troops  A B52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie and we used them 
around the clock  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb 
munitions   
 
2  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse  The adjusted figures for number 
of Patriot kills of SS1 derivitives is 6070  That figure came 
not from some fluke in the Pentagon but a someone working with such 
stuff in another part of DoD 
 
3  The statement precision bombing was the norm is true around areas 
where civilians were close to the target  We dropped by tonnage very 
little bombs in populated regions explaining the figures
