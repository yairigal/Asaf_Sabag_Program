SAME OLD BULLSHIT. NOT BEING GIVEN TO DELUSIONS AND WISHFUL THINKING
I DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF EITHER LOVING OR OBEYING THAT WHICH I HAVE
SO REASON TO BELIEVE.

>    THE RESPONSIBILITY IS ON YOU TO LOVE GOD AND TAKE A STEP TOWARD
>HIM.  HE PROMISES TO BE THERE FOR YOU, BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR YOURSELF.
>THOSE WHO DOUBT THIS OR DISPUTE IT HAVE NOT GIVIN IT A SINCERE EFFORT.

MORE BULLSHIT. I ASSURE YOU IN MY MISGUIDED YOUTH I MADE A SINCERE EFFORT.
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL BEING A RATIONAL PERSON RAISED IN CHRISTIAN HOME.
MANY OTHERS COULD TELL THE SAME STORY. YOU CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE ANYONE'S
EXPERIENCE WHICH CONTRADICTS YOUR SMUG THEORIES.
