WHAT ATHEISTS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  

IMNSHO, ABORTION IS THE WOMANS CHOICE.  HOMOSEXUAL SEX IS THE CHOICE OF 
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.  WAR IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY.  

THIS LEAVES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.  I OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHEMNT BECAUSE 
MISTAKES CAN HAPPEN (YES THIS THREAD WENT AROUND WITH NO RESOLUTION
RECENTLY).

AS FAR AS POPLULATION CONTROL, I THINK CONTRACEPTION AND EDUCATION ARE
THE BEST COURSES OF ACTION.

>I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW AN ATHEIST CAN OBJECT TO WAR (AN
>EXCELLENT MEANS OF CONTROLLING POPULATION GROWTH), OR TO CAPITAL
>PUNISHMENT, I'M SORRY BUT THE LOGIC ESCAPES ME.

THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE AGAIN MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL ATHEISTS 
HAVE SOME SPECIFIC MINDSET.

>AND WHY JUST CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, WHAT IS BEING QUESTIONED HERE, THE

MISTAKES CAN HAPPEN BILL, AND I COULD BE THE VICTIM OF SUCH A MISTAKE.
