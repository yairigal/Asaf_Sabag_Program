Not only are they not objective but they dont even stay constant 
over time   A young farmer and an old farmer on the verge of  
retirement have quite different ideas about the relative values of  
a piece of land and a dollar bill 
 
Similarly a person viewing an anonymous piece of land and a  
person viewing a piece of land that his family has lived on for 
generations 
 
These values are essentially subjective and thats why we have 
markets to allow people to match their valuations of land and 
dollar bills
