Assuming you are presenting it accurately I dont see how this argument 
really leads to any firm conclusion  The material in John Im not sure 
exactly what is referred to here but Ill take for granted the similarity 
to the MattLuke Q material IS different hence one could have almost 
any relationship between the two right up to John getting it straight from 
Jesus mouth

The version of the usual theory I have heard has Matthew and Luke 
independently relying on Mark and Q  One would think that if Luke relied 
on Matthew we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies 
for one thing

This is the part that is particularly new to me  If it were possible that 
you could point me to a reference Id be grateful

Because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing 
copy quit a bit  The further away from the original the more copies can be 
written and therefore survival becomes more probable

Im not really impressed with the theology argument  But Im really 
pointing this out as an if  And as I pointed out earlier one cannot make 
these arguments about I Peter
