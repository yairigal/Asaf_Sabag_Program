>NO.  WELL, AGAIN I STATED THAT A PAINLESS DEATH ISN'T CRUEL, BUT I DON'T
>THINK I STATED THAT ALL PAINFUL EXECUTIONS *ARE* CRUEL.  I THINK THAT SOME

	BUT HANGING IS CERTAINLY PAINFUL. OR, DO YOU NOT LET THE CONDEMNED 
KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO DIE?

	HANGING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE VERY PLEASANT. I BELIEVE THAT IN 
ACTUALITY, IT IS NOT "QUICK AND CLEAN". HOWEVER, GAS CHAMBERS CAN BE
QUITE NON-PAINFUL. HECK, WHY NOT GIVE THEM A GOOD TIME? SUFFICATION BY
NITRIOUS OXIDE!
