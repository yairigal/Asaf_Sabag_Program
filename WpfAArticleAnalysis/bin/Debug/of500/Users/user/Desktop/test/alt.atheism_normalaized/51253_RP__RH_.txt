No it in the way it is usually used In my view you are saying here that 
driving a car requires faith that the car drives 
  
For me it is a conclusion and I have no more faith in it than I have in the 
premises and the argument used

No thats a word game The term god is used in a different way usually 
When you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is 
commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is  and 
that does not exist it is existence itself so I say it does not exist 
  
Interestingly there are those who say that existence exists is one of 
the indubitable statements possible 
  
Further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is 
already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying 
more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far 
are incomplete making it a fallacy
