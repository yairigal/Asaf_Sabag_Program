I THINK IT MAY ALSO BE WORTHWHILE POINTING OUT THAT IF WE
TAKE THE APPELLATION `RABBI' SERIOUSLY THEN JESUS HAD A FULL
GRASP OF CONTEMPORARY `SCRIPTURE'

MAT21:42 JESUS SAITH UNTO THEM, DID YE NEVER READ IN THE SCRIPTURES...

MAT22:29 JESUS ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, YE DO ERR, NOT KNOWING
MAT22:29 THE SCRIPTURES, NOR THE POWER OF GOD.

FOLLOWING FROM THIS, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A WONDERFUL
POSITION TO FULFIL PROPHESIES, AND THE NT SAYS AS MUCH:

MAT26:54 BUT HOW THEN SHALL THE SCRIPTURES BE FULFILLED,
MAT26:54 THAT THUS IT MUST BE?

MAT26:56 BUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE
MAT26:56 PROPHETS MIGHT BE FULFILLED. THEN ALL THE DISCIPLES
MAT26:56 FORSOOK HIM, AND FLED.

IF THE BOOKS COMPRISING THE REFERRED-TO `SCRIPTURE' HAD NOT
BEEN ACCESSIBLE THEN IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
MATTER.
