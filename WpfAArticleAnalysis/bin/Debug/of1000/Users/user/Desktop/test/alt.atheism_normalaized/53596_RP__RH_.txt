Laugh if you want to 
 or say you dont care 
 If you cannot see it 
 you think its not there 
 It doesnt work that way

> Dont suppose you care to provide a credible citation 
 
Read your own newspapers  I dont have the space to keep them all  If I 
kept enough records to be able to respond with a couple of pages of citations 
every time some idiot said Nyaah nyaah prove it gimme a citation I 
wouldnt have any space left in my flat  Its enough work to track down 
references to prove that George Bush really said atheists shouldnt be 
considered citizens or that Einstein wasnt a Christian and those used to 
get demanded every week 
 
And I suspect if I did track down the various issues of The Guardian which 
have carried detailed reports on the subject youd dismiss them as liberal 
propaganda just like Gregg dismisses the articles about Islam in The Times 
 
Did you miss Amnesty Internationals widelyannounced report about torture in 
China  It was in the news a couple of weeks ago  Oh I forgot thats just 
liberal propaganda  I mean is it plausible that the country responsible for 
the Tienanmen Square massacre would torture and kill people  Naaah  Forget 
it 
 
Keep up the good work  Im sure Chinas Most Favoured Nation status will 
be renewed in June and you can feel really proud
