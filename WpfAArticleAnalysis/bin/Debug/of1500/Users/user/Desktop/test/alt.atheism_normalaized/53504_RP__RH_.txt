Deliberate misinterpretation of a persons statement  By cutting out 
the part of the statement he tries to blunt the thrust of the sentence 
He never addresses the issue of extreemist peace people not holding true 
to their ideals 
 
>But what makes you think that sitting back saying nothing about defense 
>issues and letting people like you make all the decisions is anything to do 
>with their ideals 
 
Ignoring the challenge  He ignores the challenge that extreemists for 
peace tend to be quite insistent that everyone accept their ideals for 
the world and have even turned quite violent  Witness Chicago summer 
1968

Paranoia  He assumes that anyone who argues against his viewpoint must 
masturbate over GunsNAmmo
