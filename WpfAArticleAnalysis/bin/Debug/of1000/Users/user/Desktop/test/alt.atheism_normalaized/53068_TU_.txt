I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH, OR KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE,
BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A WORD FOR "IDOL" AND THAT THE TRANSLATOR
WOULD HAVE USED THE WORD "IDOL" INSTEAD OF "GRAVEN IMAGE" HAD
THE ORIGINAL SAID "IDOL."  SO I THINK YOU'RE WRONG HERE, BUT
THEN AGAIN I COULD BE TOO.  I JUST SUGGESTING A WAY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THE INTERPRETATION YOU OFFER IS CORRECT.
