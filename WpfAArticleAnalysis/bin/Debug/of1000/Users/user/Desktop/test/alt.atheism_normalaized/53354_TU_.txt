  I SAW ONE THEIST ON THIS NET TALKING ABOUT THE ABSURDITY OF ONE SAYING HE
DOESN'T BELIEVE IN GOD, AND HOW CAN WE BE SURE.  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS AND
OTHER ARGUMENTS ASSUMES THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WITH THE ATHEIST. WRONG!
IN PHILOSOPHY THE ONE WHO IS MAKING A POSITIVE ARGUMENT MUST GIVE REASONS FOR
HIS BELIEVING SO, NOT THE NEGATIVE.  IF I WERE TO MAKE THE STATEMENT ELVES 
EXIST, THEN IT WOULD BE UP TO ME TO PROVE MY POSITIVE ASSERTION, NOT THE 
PERSON SAYING THAT ELVES DON'T EXIST.  IF THE NEGATIVE IN THIS CASE HAD TO 
PROVE ELVES DON'T EXIST HE WOULD HAVE TO OMNISCIENT AND KNOW EVERY INCH OF THE
UNIVERSE.  THE SAME APPLIES WITH GOD.  GIVE ME YOUR REASONS, AND YOU (THE THEIST) MAKE THE CASE.
