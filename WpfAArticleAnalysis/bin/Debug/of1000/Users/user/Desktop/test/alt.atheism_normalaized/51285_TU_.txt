	YOU AND MR. BOBBY REALLY NEED TO SIT DOWN AND DECIDE WHAT
EXACTLY ISLAM  *IS* BEFORE POSTING HERE.

	ACCORDING TO 'ZLUMBER, ONE IS NOT A MUSLIM WHEN ONE IS DOING EVIL. 
[ A MUSLIN CAN DO NO EVIL ] ACCORDING TO HIM, ONE WHO DOES EVIL IS SUFFERING 
FROM "TEMPORARY ATHIESM."

	NOW, WOULD THE MEMBERS WHO CLAIM TO BE "MUSLIMS" GET THEIR STORIES 
STRAIGHT????
