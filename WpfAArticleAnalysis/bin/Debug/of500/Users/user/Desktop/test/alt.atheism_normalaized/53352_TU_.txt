AS I UNDERSTAND THINGS, THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU ARE
ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, IT APPEARS THAT NOTHING CAN EVER ENTER THE
BLACK HOLE; AS SOMETHING APPROACHES THE EVENT HORIZON IT APPEARS TO SLOW,
AND NEVER GETS THERE. HOWEVER IF YOU ARE ON THE OBJECT LOOKING OUT YOU
GET AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT VIEW. AS YOU LOOK OUT YOU WILL SEE THE UNIVERSE
SPEED UP, AND ULTIMATELY WILL WITNESS THE COLLAPSE OR HEAT DEATH OF
THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT.
