Im sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to 
this 
 
Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism I think 
many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ  Your generalisms 
are then misplaced  atheism neednt imply materialism or the lack 
of an absolute moral system  However I do tend to materialism and 
dont believe in absolute morality so Ill answer your questions 
 
>How then can an atheist judge value  
 
An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according 
to a personal understanding of morality  That I dont believe in an 
absolute one doesnt mean that I dont have one  Im just explicit 
as in the line of postings you followed up that when I express 
judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code 
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad 
My moral code is not particular different from that of others around 
me be they Christians Muslims or atheists  So when I say that I 
object to genocide Im not expressing anything particularly out of 
line with what my society holds 
 
If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it 
does my answer would be mechanistic to your taste  that a moral 
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society and that humanity 
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of 
our ability to exist in large societies thereby achieving 
considerable survival advantages  Youd probably say that God just 
made the rules  Neither of us can convince the other but we share a 
common understanding about many moral issues  You think you get it 
from your religion I think I get it and you get it from early 
childhood teaching 
 
>That you dont like what God told people to do says nothing about God 
>or Gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your 
>nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled 
>with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction  
 
I think youve been reading the wrong sort of comic books but in 
prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what youre 
saying  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as God 
commanded the genocide
