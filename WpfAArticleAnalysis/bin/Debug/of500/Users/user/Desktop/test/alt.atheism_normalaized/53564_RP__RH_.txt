That complicated isnt in fact where PH > PHG comes from its more 
the other way around Its from 
 
  PH  =  PHG +  PHG  where G is the complement of G 
 
and by axiom Panything >= 0 so PHG >= 0 so PH >= PHG 
 
In a sense HG is necessarily more complicated than H for any H and G 
so I may be splitting hairs but what Im trying to say is that irrespective 
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is PH >= PHG 
holds with equality if and only if PHG = 0

Well Px | A = Px | B means that x is as likely to be observed if A is 
operative as it is if B is operative This implies that observing x does not 
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between 
the respective possibilities that A and B are operative the difference 
reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior 
probabilities PA and PB 
 
  Px | A = Px | B  ==> 
 
    PA | x  =  k PA   and   PB | x  =  k PB 
 
where k  =  Px | A  Px  =  Px | B  Px 
 
So A and B are equally consistent with the data in that observing x 
doesnt give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative 
 
In the particular case where A = H and B = HG however we know that their 
prior probabilities are ordered by PH >=
