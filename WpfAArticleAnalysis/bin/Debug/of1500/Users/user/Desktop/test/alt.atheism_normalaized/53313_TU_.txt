THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.  IF I WANT TO KILL YOU, I CAN BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I
DECIDE?
>>
>>1)WHO IS SOCIETY

>I THINK THIS IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS

NOT REALLY.  IF WHATEVER A PARTICULAR SOCIETY MANDATES AS OK IS OK, THERE ARE
ALWAYS SOME IN THE "SOCIETY" WHO DISAGREE WITH THE MANDATES, SO WHICH 
SOCIETAL MANDATES MAKE THE STANDARD FOR MORALITY?
 >>
>>2)HOW DO "THEY" DEFINE WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE?

>GENERALLY BY WHAT THEY "FEEL" IS RIGHT, WHICH IS THE MOST IDIOTIC POLICY I CAN
>THINK OF.

SO WHAT SHOULD BE THE BASIS? UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO ADMIT TO BEING TIED AT 
LEAST LOOSELY TO THE "FEELING", IN THAT I THINK WE INTUITIVELY KNOW SOME THINGS
TO BE WRONG.  AWFULLY HARD TO DEFEND, THOUGH.
>>
>>3)HOW DO WE KEEP FROM A "WHATEVER IS LEGAL IS WHAT IS "MORAL" "POSITION?

>BY THINKING FOR OURSELVES.

I MIGHT AGREE HERE.  JUST BECAUSE CERTAIN ACTIONS ARE LEGAL DOES NOT MAKE THEM
"MORAL".
