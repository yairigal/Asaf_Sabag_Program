And that of course is the point   You cant simply divide the 
world into atheists and nonatheists on the basis of godbelief 
 
If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and 
have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural 
being is your criterion 
 
But once you start talking about behaviour then someones suscept 
ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  
are  I assume  worried about 
 
And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical 
critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and 
easily led on the other 
 
I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates 
that a person is easily led   Whether they have a worship or belief  
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be 
beside the point
