An Islamic Bank is something which operates in a different fashion to 
your modern bank as I have explained here on another thread before 
For example Islamic banks dont pay fixed interests on deposits but a 
return on investments which varies according to the market and is not 
fixed like interest is 
 
Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world 
There are no Islamic banks in the West including the USA to my 
knowledge  I doubt if the market for them exists there  at least not 
while Islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their 
development as is the case now  BCCI is most certainly not an Islamic 
bank  did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits  If the 
answer to this question is yes then BCCI was not an Islamic bank as 
Islamic banks are specifically set up to not pay or charge interest 
 
Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely 
irrelevant
