 Deletia in case anybody hadnt noticed Frank and I are debating 
  objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics

      It may be that being a nonnative Englishspeaker Ive 
misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something 
you dont assert my apologies Im at a loss to imagine what you really 
do mean though

      Wrong point The age of the universe has no direct effect on 
humanitys sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can 
have 
 
      Im saying the Universe has a real age because I see evidence 
for it cosmology astronomy and so on I say this age is independent of 
peoples opinions of it because I know different people have a lot of 
different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem 
to give roughly the same results

      I cant see how it does that Put a creationist to the task of 
performing the tests and calculations see to it she makes no blatant 
errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be 
the same

      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their 
opinion If those tests were just my opinion then their own tests 
which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we 
conducted said tests in identical manner no They dont which I take 
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them

      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean 
physical pain You have a sharp point Ill give you that but you still 
havent given me a way to quantify morality 
 
> I wrote

      We agree Hypotheses however can change I hold that there is no 
ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could 
gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable 
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes

      Better and worse are almost always defined in the context 
of a moral system Your prediction will always be correct *within* 
*that* *moral* *system* What you need now is an objective definition of 
good and bad I wish you luck

      Isnt that what youre doing when assuming an objectively 
real morality Besides what exactly is provably wrong with my 
statement
