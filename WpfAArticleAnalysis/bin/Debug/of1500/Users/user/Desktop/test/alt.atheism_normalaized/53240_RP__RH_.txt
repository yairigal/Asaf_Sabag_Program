I have never been to Wisconsin though I have been to 
neighbor Minnesota Being a child of the Middle Atlantic NY NJ PA 
I found that there were few states in the provences that stood 
out in this youngsters mind California Texas and Florida to  
name the most obvious three  However both Minnesota and Wisconsin 
stuck out solely on the basis of their politics  Both have  
always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states 
And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that 
states reputation  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the 
same  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left 
with me about their neighbors 
 
The only question in my head about Wisconsin though is  
whether or not there is a causeeffect relationship between 
cheese and serial killers
