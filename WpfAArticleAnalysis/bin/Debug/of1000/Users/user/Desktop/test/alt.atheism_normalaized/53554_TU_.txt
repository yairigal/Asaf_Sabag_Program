MARK MCCULLOUGH (MCCULLOU@SNAKE10.CS.WISC.EDU) WROTE:
: I HEARD ABOUT THE ARMS SALE TO SAUDI ARABIA.  NOW, HOW IS IT SUCH A GRAVE
: MISTAKE TO SELL SAUDI ARABIA WEAPONS?  OR ARE YOU CLAIMING THAT WE SHOULDN'T
: SELL ANY WEAPONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES?  STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWER PLEASE.

SAUDI ARABIA IS AN OPPRESSIVE REGIME THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY INTERFERING
IN THE POLITCS OF NEWLY RENUNIFIED YEMEN, INCLUDING ASSASINATIONS AND 
BORDER INCURSIONS. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL SOON INVADE.
UNLUCKILY FOR YEMEN IT IS NOT POPULAR IN THE WEST AS THEY MANAGED TO PUT
ASIDE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES DURING REUNIFICATION AND THUS THE WEST HAS
EFFECTIVELY LOST ONE HALF (NORTH?) AS A CLIENT STATE.
