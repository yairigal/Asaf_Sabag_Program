Im not saying this at all  it requires no faith on my part to 
say the car drives because Ive seen it drive  Ive done more 
than at in fact  Ive actually driven it now what does require 
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation 
of whats out there But there is NO evidence  pro or con  
for the existence or nonexistence of God see what I have to 
say below on this

Sorry if I remain skeptical  I dont believe its entirely a 
conclusion That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God 
is correct  neither have I But lack of evidence for the existence  
of something is in NO WAY evidence for the nonexistence of something  
the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  
disprove evolution the establish creation You personally have never  
seen a neutrino before but they exist The pink unicorn analogy breaks 
down and is rather naive I have a scientific theory that explains the  
appearance of animal life  evolution When I draw the conclusion that  
pink unicorns dont exist because I havent seen them this conclusion 
has its foundation in observation and theory A pink unicorn if 
it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities 
That is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has 
evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share  
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such God however 
has no such correspondence with anything IMO There is no physical 
frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM

I disagree with you profoundly on this I havent defined God as 
existence  in fact I havent defined God But this might be 
getting off the subject  although if you think its relevant 
we can come back to it

You are using wrong categories here  or perhaps you misunderstand 
what Im saying Im making no argument what so ever and offering no 
definition so there is no fallacy Im not trying to convince you of 
anything *I* Believe  and that rests upon Faith And it is inappropriate 
to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you 
that they can logically prove God or that they have evidence or  
then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary 
 
BTW an incomplete argument is not a fallacy  some things are not 
EVEN wrong

I dont follow you here Certainly one can make observations of 
things that they didnt know existed I still maintain that one 
cannot use observation to infer that God does not exist Such 
a positive assertion requires a leap

Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me I have no 
EVIDENCE that god is is meaningful at ANY level Maybe such 
a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so 
many people try to run their own private conception of God down 
your throat I however am not doing this I am arguing one and 
only one thing  that to make a positive assertion about something 
for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against 
requires a leap  it requires faith I am as you would say a 
theist however there is a form of atheism that I can respect  
but it must be founded upon honesty
