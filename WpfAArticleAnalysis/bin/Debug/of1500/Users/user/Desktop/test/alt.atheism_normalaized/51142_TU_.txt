WELL, I'VE SAID THAT WHEN AN INNOCENT PERSON HAS BEEN EXECUTED, THIS IS
OBJECTIVELY A MURDER.  HOWEVER, WHO IS AT BLAME IS ANOTHER QUESTION.
IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE SOCIETY THAT SANCTIONS ANY SORTS OF EXECUTIONS--
REALIZING THE RISKS--IS TO BLAME.

YES, BUT THERE IS ALSO A PROBABLITY THAT YOU WILL KILL SOMEONE DOING
ANY RAONDOM ACTIVITY.  PRESUMABLY, YOU HAD NOT ISOLATED YOURSELF TOTALLY
FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THIS.

>>AND, DRIVING WILL KILL PEOPLE, AS WILL AIRLINES, BUT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DO
>>BOTH.
>DRIVING AND FLYING ARE NOT PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED ON UNWILLING

>WILLINGLY.

AND I ARGUE THAT OUR LAW SYSTEM IS A SIMILAR RISK.  PERHAPS AN INNOCENT
PERSON WILL BE PUNISHED SOMEDAY, BUT WE WORK TO PREVENT THIS.  IN FACT,
MANY CRIMINALS GO FREE AS A RESULT OF OUR TRYING TO PREVENT PUNISHMENT
OF INNOCENTS.

>IF OUR OWN DRIVING KILLS SOMEONE ELSE, THEN SURE, THERE IS A MORAL

BUT, SUCH ACCIDENTS ARE TO BE TOTALLY EXPECTED, GIVEN THE NUMNER OF VEHICALS
ON THE ROAD.  AGAIN, THE BLAME IS ON SOCIETY.

>>NO I'M NOT.  THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID.  YOU WERE SAYING THAT IF THERE WERE SUCH

YES, BUT THE STATE IS NOT AT FAULT IN SUCH A CASE.  THE STATE CAN ONLY DO
SO MUCH TO PREVENT FALSE WITNESSES.

>>IT IS POSSIBLE.  SO, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
>>IS ALWAYS MURDER BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILTY OF HUMAN ERROR INVALIDATING

OKAY, SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL MURDER.  BUT, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT
ALL SUCH "MURDERS" ARE WRONG.  ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL TAKING OF HUMAN LIFE
IS WRONG, NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

>IF WE, AS A SOCIETY, DECIDE TO MURDER SOMEONE, THEN WE SHOULD SAY

>MURDER ISN'T MURDER.  AND THAT'S *MY* OPINION ABOUT HOW SOCIETY

BUT, THIS IS BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS.  SOCIETY ACCEPTS THE RISK THAT AN
INNOCENT PERSON WILL BE MURDERED BY EXECUTION.  AND, EVERY MEMBER OF
SOCIETY SHARES THIS BLAME.  AND, MOST PEOPLE'S DEFINITIONS OF MURDER
INCLUDE SOME SORT OF MALICIOUS INTENT, WHICH IS NOT INVOLVED IN AN
EXECUTION, IS IT?

>>BUT, WE WERE TRYING TO DISCUSS AN OBJECTIVE MORAL SYSTEM, OR AT LEAST ITS

>NO, WE WERE NOT DISCUSSING AN OBJECTIVE MORAL SYSTEM.  I WAS SHOWING

MURDER VIOLATES THE GOLDEN RULE.  EXECUTIONS DO NOT, BECAUSE BY ALLOWING
IT AT ALL, SOCIETY IMPLICITLY ACCEPTS THE CONSEQUENCES NO MATTER WHO THE
INNOCENT VICTIM IS.

>>WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT READING MINDS, WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT KNOWING THE
>>TRUTH.  YES, WE CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE THE TRUTH, BUT
>>THE COURT SYSTEMS WORK ON A PRINCIPLE OF KNOWING THE "TRUTH" "BEYOND A

>SORRY, BUT YOU SIMPLY ARE NOT QUOTING YOURSELF ACCURATELY.  HERE

>QUITE DIFFERENT.  THE JURY BEING *PERSUADED* BEYOND A SERIOUS
>DOUBT IS NOT THE SAME AS US KNOWING WHAT IS IN THEIR MINDS BEYOND
>A SERIOUS DOUBT.

READING THE MINDS OF THE JURY WOULD CERTAINLY TELL WHETHER OR NOT A CONVICTION
WAS MORAL OR NOT.  BUT, IN AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM, ONLY THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
MATTERS, AND THE JURY SYSTEM IS ONE METHOD TO APPROXIMATE SUCH A TRUTH.  THAT
IS, TWELVE MEMBERS MUST BE CONVINCED OF A TRUTH.

>MOREOVER, A JURY WHICH COMES FROM A SUFFICIENTLY PREJUDICED BACKGROUND
>MAY ALLOW ITSELF TO BE PERSUADED BEYOND A SERIOUS DOUBT ON EVIDENCE
>THAT YOU AND I WOULD LAUGH AT.

BUT THEN, IF WE READ THE MINDS OF THESE PEOPLE, WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE
CONVICTION WAS UNFAIR.

>>BUT, WOULD IT BE PERFECTLY FAIR IF WE COULD READ MINDS?  IF WE ASSUME THAT
>>IT WOULD BE FAIR IF WE KNEW THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH, WHY IS IT SO MUCH LESS
>>FAIR, IN YOUR OPINION, IF WE ONLY HAVE A GOOD APPROXIMATION OF THE ABSOLUTE

>IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS.  YOUR CLAIM, WHICH I HAVE QUOTED

YES, WHILE WE COULD OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE (IF WE KNEW ALL
POSSIBLE INFORMATION), WE CAN'T ALWAYS DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR
FLAWED SYSTEM.  I THINK THAT OUR SYSTEM IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE,
BUT IT STILL ISN'T OBJECTIVELY PERFECT.  YOU SEE, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
WE *KNOW* IT IS FAIR OR NOT.  OBJECTIVELY, IT IS EITHER FAIR OR IT IS NOT.

>NOW THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.  IF WE CAN READ MINDS, WE CAN KNOW,
>AND IF WE CANNOT READ MINDS, WE CAN KNOW NOTHING.  THE DIFFERENCE
>IS NOT IN DEGREE OF FAIRNESS, BUT IN WHAT WE CAN KNOW.

BUT WHAT WE KNOW HAS NO EFFECT ON AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM.

>>I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A FAIRLY OBJECTIVE SYSTEM, IF WE ARE
>>CLEAR ON WHICH GOALS IT IS SUPPOSED TO PROMOTE.
>I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME TRYING TO DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT I AM
>PRETTY SURE DOES NOT EXIST.

WHY ARE YOU SO SURE?

>I SIMPLY WANT PEOPLE TO CONFRONT REALITY.  *MY* REALITY, REMEMBER.

WHY IS *YOUR* REALITY IMPORTANT?

>MAY HAVE BEEN A DOZEN INNOCENT PEOPLE EXECUTED, OR A HUNDRED, OR
>NONE AT ALL.  WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW.

BUT, WE CAN ASSUME THAT THE SYSTEM IS FAIRLY DECENT, AT LEAST MOST LIKELY.
AND, YOU REALIZE THAT THE CORRECTNESS OF OUR SYSTEM SAYS NOTHING ABOUT A
TOTALLY IDEAL AND OBJECTIVE SYSTEM.

>NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?  ON THE ONE HAND, WE CAN PRETEND

WELL, WE CAN HAVE AN IDEAL SYSTEM, BUT THE WORKING SYSTEM CAN NOT BE IDEAL.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS AS CLOSE AN APPROXIMATION TO
THE IDEAL SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE.

YES, WE ALL BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY.  MOST PEOPLE SEEM WILLING TO DO THIS.

WE MUST REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL OUR ACTIONS.  WHY DO YOU KEEP
SEPARATING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM THE PACK?
