I think itd help if we got a couple good atheists or even some good 
steadfast agnostics in some high political offices  When was the last 
time we had an openly atheist president  Have we ever  I dont 
actually know these arent rhetorical questions  How bout some 
Supreme court justices   
 
One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news 
program on a local stationThe promo said something like Who are 
these cults and why do they prey on the young  Ahem  EVER HEAR OF 
BAPTISM AT BIRTH  If that isnt preying on the young I dont know what 
is 
 
I used to be ack barf a Catholic and was even confirmedShortly 
thereafter I decided it was a load of BS  My mom who really insisted 
that I continue to go to church felt it was her duty  to bring me up 
as a believer  That was one of the more presumptuous things Ive heard 
in my life  I suggested we go talk to the priest and she agreed  The 
priest was amazingly cool about itHe basically said that if I didnt 
believe it there was no good in forcing it on me  Actually I guess he 
wasnt amazingly cool about itHis response is what youd hope for 
indeed expect from a human being  I spose I just didnt expect 
it   
 
I find it absurd that religion exists Yet I can also see its 
usefulness to people  Facing up to the fact that youre just going to 
be worm food in a few decades and that there isnt some cosmic purpose 
to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people  
Having a readilyavailable predigested solution to this is pretty 
attractive if youre either a gullible enough b willing to suspend 
your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind or c have had the stuff 
rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember  Religion in 
general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses Organized 
religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control   
 
Blech
