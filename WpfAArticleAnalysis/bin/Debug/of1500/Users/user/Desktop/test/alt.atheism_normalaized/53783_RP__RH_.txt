no its not 
 
its due to the fact that there are two issues here Religion and religion 
 
religion is personal belief system 
Religion is a memetic virus 
 
people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from 
religion > Religion  people that want to save others are firmly 
entrenched in Religion memoids 
 
rule 1 of not practicing Religion is to shut the fuck up unless 
you discuss it politely  this means that the motive behind the conversation 
is not only your selfgratifying wish to spread the word   
 
religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person and 
reflects their value judgements  Religion is something that is 
contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements 
other than perhaps i think ill be brainwashed today 
 
Religion is a drug 
 
i believe you can discuss religion  however the post that started this 
off was not intented as discussion it was more a proclamation of 
someones Religion 
 
if you think im talking about censorship or that im closeminded you havent 
understood this  i dont have any problem with the discussion of  
religion its just Religion that i cant stand
