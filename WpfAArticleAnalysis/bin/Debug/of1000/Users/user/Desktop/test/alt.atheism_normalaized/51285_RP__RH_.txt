	You and Mr bobby really need to sit down and decide what 
exactly Islam  *is* before posting here 
 
	According to Zlumber one is NOT a muslim when one is doing evil  
 A muslin can do no evil  According to him one who does evil is suffering  
from temporary athiesm 
 
	Now would the members who claim to be Muslims get their stories  
straight 
 
 
 
 
       Satan and the Angels do not have freewill   
        They do what god tells them to do
