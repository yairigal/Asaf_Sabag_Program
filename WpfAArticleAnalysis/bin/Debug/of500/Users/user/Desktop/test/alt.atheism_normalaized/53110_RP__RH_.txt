False dichotomy  You claimed the killing were *not* religiously 
motivated and Im saying thats wrong   Im not saying that 
each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out

Sorry Frank but what I put in quotes is your own words from your 
posting  Dont tell us now that  
its a different claim   If you can no longer stand behind your  
original claim just say so
