 If there is a God as described by the Christians for instance then 
 He has existence apart from and independent of humankind His 
 existence is outside of our frame of reference reality 
 
Thus god does not really exist How true This claim would 
lend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually 
seamless virtual realities 
 
Does god exist or not To us this question is a true dichotomy 
 
Can god know a reason for her existence If she is omniscient then 
she must know this There is a philosophical problem whether anything 
can exist without a time frame  for instance if it were possible to 
observe our universe from outside in the neverness surrounding 
this universe it would never have existed  
 
Thus we are faced with a trilemma 
 
1 God metaexists and from this metaexisting perspective she 
created existence the Universe and everything  
 
This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing which 
is precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis Lizhi  Shuxian  
Creation of the Universe say This nothingness is not empty enough 
it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence 
until there is no when yet but never mind god the source of 
all existence started to play I fail to see the difference between 
these two forms of nothingness though If there isnt one it might 
be god is not necessary for creation 
 
It is obvious that the levels of metaexistence are not necessarily 
limited to god there might be a metagod on some other level 
 
2 God exists and has always existed she has a timescale which 
is different from our own This sounds sensible but it is difficult 
to conceive how she could know why she exists  a being which 
has always existed and is infinitely conscious of itself can 
remember that she has always been the same and perhaps know herself 
completely but she cannot know why she exists and how she knows 
everything she knows Would a knowledge of how a being with a  
personality a subjective viewpoint knows everything be this 
beings knowledge A conscious being conscious of everything is 
actually a contradiction in terms  it means that god is only 
conscious of herself since we and the whole universe are 
already incorporated in her mental models thoroughly modelled 
Actually a conscious being conscious of only itself is not 
conscious at all  
 
3 God is herself the Existence This is nothing more than an Orwellian 
redefinition of the word existence A logical consequence of this 
statement is that god is actually all existence I think this is 
also called a form of pantheism 
 
 If this 
 being declares a thing to be so it is necessarily so since He has 
 defined Himself as omnipotent and if His claims are to be believed 
 He is at least omnipotent relative to us God is intrinsically 
 selfdefined and all reality is whatever He says it is  in an 
 objective sense 
 
In a reality god is supposed to have created I cannot believe in 
her is that my fault or the creators fault God gave me freedom 
of choice but nevertheless knows what I will opt for is it fair 
play on her side 
 
If god has a conscious mind in any sense she has a point of view 
Id say she is entitled to her opinions about me but I still insist 
that any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with  
resistance and disapproval  
 
 If God determines a standard of conduct that standard is objective 
 
No an objective standard means something independent on any 
subjective viewpoint including gods point of view  
 
 If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that 
 standard while permitted to ignore it they substitute a relative 
 morality or mode of conduct giving the term morality a nebulous 
 meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to 
 misunderstand The standard is objective and the conduct required to 
 meet that standard is therefore objectively determined 
 
What standard My morality and my conscience  disagrees with the 
standards of the Bible Which one to ignore How to interpret 
any divine standard There is a great discrepancy even among  
Christians on this For instance the Bible does not condemn 
female homosexuality  why many Christians do thinking god doesnt 
accept it anyway 
 
Bill to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make the 
term nebulous Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour 
something we can change and something that must change when 
societies change It might be some basic concepts are hardwired 
in our brains by evolution but in the end we must decide ourselves 
I dont think people need religion to keep them moral  
thinking goes beyond threat of punishment  
 
 Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is 
 infinitely malleable doesnt mean that the objective standard itself 
 doesnt exist Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural 
 norm or the preferred conduct of decent people making it seem 
 subjective but it is derived from an absolute objective standard 
 
Ive yet to see an objective standard that is  
 
a universally applicable today and tomorrow 
b universally acceptable not against our own concepts of what is 
moral and what isnt 
 
 Ironically this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true 
 nature according to Christianity at least yet is condemned as being 
 contrary to human nre oppressive and severe This may be due as 
 much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself but like it 
 or not its there 
 
I dont think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard 
although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time 
and much of it is still applicable The problem is that I cant 
agree with it all This is not a question of comforting my 
conscience with a thought that I wont be responsible with what 
I do as Christians would put it My conscience is in an irreconcilable 
conflict with the Bible on homosexuality Pauls idea of womens 
role in marriage etc and the whole idea that I should believe 
in someone I got no help from in this task
