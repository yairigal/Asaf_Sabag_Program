NOTE THAT I _NEVER_ SAID THAT DEPRESSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
NUCLEAR FAMILY IS DUE _SOLELY_ TO EXTRA-MARITAL SEX.  I SPECIFICALLY
SAID THAT IT WAS "A PRIME CAUSE" OF THIS, NOT "THE PRIME CAUSE" OR "THE
ONLY CAUSE" OF THIS -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER FACTORS
TOO, BUT I THINK THAT EXTRA-MARITAL SEX AND SUBSEQUENT DESTABILIZATION
OF THE FAMILY IS PROBABLY A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO THE RISE IN
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION, IN THE WEST IN THE 20TH
CENTURY.
