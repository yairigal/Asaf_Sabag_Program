I dont think there is really any question about which god the courts 
mean  The request for solemnly swearing so help you god 
 is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand 
and hold up your right hand  In the courts of NC at least it is always 
an old and new testament 
 
Though it is hard to imagine picking up the bible and swearing to whatever 
god is sometimes the least of the religious influence  There is a court in 
Greensboro NC where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroom 
stand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session  Ive thought about 
sitting through it but Im not terribly anxious to spend 30 days in jail
