That means that it is an effective antirecidivism measure  It does 
not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime 
in the first place 
 
The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually 
stop one from murdering  Or commiting treason  are there any other 
capital crimes anywhere in the USA  That is if there were no death 
penalty would its introduction deter a wouldbe criminal from 
committing herhis crime  I doubt it 
 
This is only the first step  Even if it were a strong deterrent 
short of being a complete deterrent I would reject it  For what 
about the case of the innocent executed 
 
And even if we could eliminate this possibility I would reject the 
death penalty as immoral This makes me something of a radical on 
the issue although I think there are many opponents of captial 
punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the 
strongest argument to make 
 
I would if magically placed in charge facilitate stateaided suicide 
for criminals who have lifesentences  This could be a replacement 
for capital punishment  Those who dont want to live the rest of 
their lives in jail would always have this option
