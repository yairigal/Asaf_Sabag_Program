Okay I argued this thoroughly about 34 weeks ago  Men and women are 
different  physically physiologically and psychologically  Much 
recent evidence for this statement is present in the book Brainsex by 
Anne Moir and David Jessel  I recommend you find a copy and read it 
Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic 
and is well referenced  
 
Now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only 
adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are 
different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women 
are different  Maternity leave is an example of this  it takes into 
account that women get pregnant  It does not give women the same rules 
it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this 
instance would be unjust  This is just simply an obvious example of 
where men and women are intrinsically different 
 
Now people make the naive argument that sexism = oppression 
However maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT  
Men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same 
extent or degree and therefore IT IS SEXIST  No matter however much a 
man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave HE NEVER CAN  And 
therefore the law IS SEXIST  No man can have access to maternity leave 
NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT  I hope this is clear 
 
Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the 
sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature
