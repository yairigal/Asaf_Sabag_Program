YES, AND EVERYONE THINKS AS YOU DO.  NO ONE THINKS THAT HE IS GOING TO CAUSE
OR BE INVOLVED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD IS SURPRISINGLY HIGH.
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MAN ON THE FIRING SQUAD WHOSE GUN IS SHOOTING
BLANKS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE LESS GUILTY.

YOU MEAN THAT KILLING IS WRONG IN ALL BUT ONE SITUTATION?  AND, YOU SHOULD
NOTE THAT THAT SITUATION WILL NEVER OCCUR.  THERE ARE ALWAYS OTHER OPTIONS
THANK KILLING.  WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY THAT ALL KILLING IS WRONG.  THIS
IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

BUT, MOST PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THE RISK TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  YOU ARE PROBABLY
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN A PLANE CRASH, OR EVEN USING AN ELECTRIC
BLENDER, THAN YOU ARE TO BE EXECUTED AS AN INNOCENT.  I PERSONALLY THINK
THAT THE RISK IS ACCEPTABLE, BUT IN AN IDEAL MORAL SYSTEM, NO SUCH RISK
IS ACCEPTABLE.  "ACCEPTABLE" IS THE FUDGE FACTOR NECESSARY IN SUCH AN
APPROXIMATION TO THE IDEAL.
