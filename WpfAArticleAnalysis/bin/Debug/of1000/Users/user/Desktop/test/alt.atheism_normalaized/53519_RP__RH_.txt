  The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the 
  incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb 
  through my archives and pull out some of The Best of AltAtheism 
  for your reading pleasure  Ill post a couple of these a day 
  unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good 
  material 
 
  I havent been particularly careful in the past about saving 
  attributions  I think the following comes from John A Johnson 
  but someone correct me if Im wrong  This is probably the longest 
  of my entire collection 
 
 
 
 
                                  So that the 
                                  Prophecy be 
                                   Fulfilled 
 
                                     * * * 
 
       In considering the Christian religion and judging it 
according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at 
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy  The scribe Matthew is perhaps 
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in 
the career of Jesus of Nazareth  As you will see Matthews main 
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even 
about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in 
the New Testament  We must also bear in mind the question of the 
authenticity of the accounts  Since the gospels were written at 
least 35 years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much 
happened exactly as stated  But for purposes of analysis we 
will take particular claims at face value 
 
Immanuel 
 
       We begin of course at the beginning 
 
       Mt 12122  Mary will bear a son and you 
       Joseph will name him Jesus which means Gd is 
       salvation for he will save his people from their 
       sins  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had 
       spoken by a prophet 
 
       Isaiah 7116  In the days of Ahaz c 750 BCE 
       king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made 
       war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not 
       quite conquer it  When the house of David ie Ahaz 
       and his court in Judah were told of this its 
       heart and the heart of its people shook   And the 
       lord Gd said to Isaiah go to meet with Ahaz  
       And the lord spoke to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah 
       naturally saying Ask a sign of Gd your lord  It 
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven  But 
       Ahaz said I wont ask I will not put the lord to a 
       test  Then Isaiah said Hear then O house of 
       David  Is it not enough for you to weary men that 
       you must weary my god too  Therefore the lord 
       himself will give you a sign  Behold a young woman 
       is with child and will bear a son and name him 
       Immanuel which means Gd is with us   He will 
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil 
       and choose good  For before the child knows how to 
       refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings 
       you dread will have been deserted 
 
Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics  
Further he the Hebrew word almah young woman as 
specifically virgin  But this is not a prophecy about the 
Messiah  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years 
later  It is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother  In 
short it not about Jesus  Matthew has made use of a verse out of 
context and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary
