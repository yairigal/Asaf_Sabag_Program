I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since 
we dont have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity 
and since the whole issue of depression isnt at all well  
defined for earlier centuries you are probably talking crap 
 
Of course you could pull a Mozumder on us and say that people 
who are having sex outside marriage are *defined* to be depressed 
 
I cant say Id ever noticed myself
