Thats a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out 
 
Its not a fallacy  note the IF   IF a supermajority of disinterested people  
agree on a fundamantal value were not doing ethics YET Benedikt then what  
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial 
observation 
 
For one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon Unlike 
a football Further you conveniently ignore here that there are 
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something The analogy 
does not hold 
 
I have however given an example of a VALUE people agree on and explained 
why  People will agree that their freedom is valuable  I have also 
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective 
ethics  the IF assertion above  And that is what Im talking about there 
isnt a point in talking about ethics if this cant be agreed 
 
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football 
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees 
with a set of morals YOU have to give 
 
Im not doing morals ethics if we cant get past values  As I say 
the only cogent objection to my freedom example is that maybe people 
arent talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable 
Maybe not and I want to think about this some especially the implications 
of its being true 
 
Further the above is evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of testing 
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories 
 
Garbage  Thats not proof either 
 
The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer 
the objections Evidence that you are a preacher 
 
Name that fallacy
