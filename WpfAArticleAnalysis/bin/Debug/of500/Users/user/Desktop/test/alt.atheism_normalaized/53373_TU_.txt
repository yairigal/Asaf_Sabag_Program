IN ARTICLE 734849678@SATURN.WWC.EDU, BISSDA@SATURN.WWC.EDU (DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL) WRITES:
->	FIRST I WANT TO START RIGHT OUT AND SAY THAT I'M A CHRISTIAN.  IT 
->MAKES SENSE TO BE ONE.  HAVE ANY OF YOU READ TONY CAMPOLLO'S BOOK- LIAR, 
->LUNATIC, OR THE REAL THING?  (I MIGHT BE A LITTLE OFF ON THE TITLE, BUT HE 
->WRITES THE BOOK.  ANYWAY HE WAS PART OF AN EFFORT TO DESTROY CHRISTIANITY, 
->IN THE PROCESS HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN HIMSELF.

SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING HE WAS A PART OF SOME CONSPIRACY.  JUST WHAT ORGANIZATION DID HE 
BELONG TO? DOES IT HAVE A NAME?

->	THE BOOK SAYS THAT JESUS WAS EITHER A LIAR, OR HE WAS CRAZY ( A 
->MODERN DAY KORESH) OR HE WAS ACTUALLY WHO HE SAID HE WAS.

LOGIC ALERT - ARTIFICIAL TRIFERCATION.  THE ARE MANY OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLAINATIONS.  COULD HAVE BEEN
THAT HE NEVER EXISTED.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GOOD POINTS MADE IN THIS GROUP THAT IS NOT 
IMPOSSIBLE  THAT JC IS AN AMALGAM OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MYTHS, MITHRA COMES TO MIND.

->	SOME REASONS WHY HE WOULDN'T BE A LIAR ARE AS FOLLOWS.  WHO WOULD 
->DIE FOR A LIE?  WOULDN'T PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TELL IF HE WAS A LIAR?  PEOPLE 
->GATHERED AROUND HIM AND KEPT DOING IT, MANY GATHERED FROM HEARING OR SEEING 
->SOMEONE WHO WAS OR HAD BEEN HEALED.  CALL ME A FOOL, BUT I BELIEVE HE DID 
->HEAL PEOPLE.  


LOGIC ALERT -  ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY.  JUST BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE THIS DOESN'T
MEAN THAT IT ISN'T TRUE.  LIARS CAN BE VERY PURSUASIVE, JUST LOOK AT KORESH THAT YOU YOURSELF SITE.
HE HAS FOLLOWERS THAT DON'T THINK HE IS A FAKE AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO DIE.
BY NOT GIVING UP AFTER GETTING SHOT HIMSELF, KORESH HAS SHOWN THAT HE TOO IS WILL TO DIE FOR WHAT 
HE BELIEVES.  AS FAR AS HEALING GOES.  IF I REMEMER RIGHT THE HEALING THAT WAS ATTRIBUTED IS NOT
CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GOSPELS.  IN ONE OF THEM THE HEALING THAT IS DONE IS NOT ANY MORE 
THAT FAITH HEALERS CAN PULL OFF TODAY.  SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EARLY GOSPELS WEREN'T THAT COMPELING,
SO THE STORIES GOT BIGGER TO APPEAL BETTER.

->	NIETHER WAS HE A LUNATIC.  WOULD MORE THAN AN ENTIRE NATION BE DRAWN 
->TO SOMEONE WHO WAS CRAZY.  VERY DOUBTFUL, IN FACT REDICULOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE 
->ANYONE WHO IS DRAWN TO DAVID KORESH IS OBVIOUSLY A FOOL, LOGICAL PEOPLE SEE 
->THIS RIGHT AWAY.
->	THEREFORE SINCE HE WASN'T A LIAR OR A LUNATIC, HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE 
->REAL THING.  


OR MIGHT NOT HAVE EXISTED, OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.  THAT IS THE LOGICAL PITFALL THAT THOSE WHO
USE FLAWED LOGIC LIKE THIS FALL INTO.  THERE ARE BIFURCATIONS (OR TRI, QUAD, ETC) THAT ARE VALID, BECAUSE
IN THE PROCEEDING STEPS,
