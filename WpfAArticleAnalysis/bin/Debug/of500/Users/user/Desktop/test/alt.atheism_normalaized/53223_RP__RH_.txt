Sorry   Wrong    This is how banks got started in the first place 
Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone 
who eventually goes broke and then they will realise that they 
havnt been managing risk very well   Then they will ask themselves 
what it is that they need to quantify risk and to persuade borrowers 
not to take on greater loans than they can carry    And since they 
dont all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the 
money some of them will specialise in that 
 
Then theyll reinvent interest but like good Muslims theyll call 
it something else

Riiiight   Thats why John Major opened a new government department 
a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business   Because 
they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar
