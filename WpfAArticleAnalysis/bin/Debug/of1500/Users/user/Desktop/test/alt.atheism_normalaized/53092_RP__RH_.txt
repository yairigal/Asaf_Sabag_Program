What do you mean when you say I would have no objection 
 
Do you mean its moral to use force on someone who advocates 
the use of force 
 
Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such 
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing 
that our own actions in doing so are not moral
