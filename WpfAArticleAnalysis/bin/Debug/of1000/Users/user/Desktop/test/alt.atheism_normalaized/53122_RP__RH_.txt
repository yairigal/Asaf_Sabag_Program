Thats like saying that since mathematics includes no instructions on 
how to act it is evil  Atheism is not a moral system so why should 
it speak of instructions on how to act  *Atheism is simply lack of 
belief in God* 
 
  Plenty of theists

I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide 
can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide 
This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act 
and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide  However since 
the atheist set of instructions is the null set how can you show that 
atheism causes genocide
