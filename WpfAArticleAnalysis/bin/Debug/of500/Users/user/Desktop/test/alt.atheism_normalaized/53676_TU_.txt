ONCE THE RUSHDIE SITUATION EXPLODED INTO THE MEDIA, THE MUSLIM VOICE ON
THE MATTER OF THE BOOK WAS EFFECTIVELY RESTRICTED TO SHORT VIDEO BYTES
SHOWING
THE DRAMATIC HIGHLIGHTS OF MUSLIM DEMONSTRATIONS. FOR EVERY TWENTY OR SO
NEWSPAPER, MAGAZINE ARTICLES, INTERVIEWS ETC. SUPPORTING RUSHDIE, THERE
WOULD
APPEAR ONE MUSLIM VOICE. THIS PERSON WAS USUALLY SELECTED BASED ON HOW
DRAMATIC AND INCOHERENT HE WAS, NOT ON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ISLAM OR THE
SITUATION AT THE TIME. THIS APPROX. TWENTY TO ONE RATIO CONTINUED
THROUGHOUT THE ESCALATION OF THE CRISIS, WITH RUSHDIE IN THE CENTRAL
SPOTLIGHT AS THE MAN OF THE MOMENT, THE VALIANT DEFENDER OF EVERYMAN'S
RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH DECOUPLED FROM RESPONSIBILITY. (AS AN ASIDE, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT WHILE THE HUE AND CRY ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH WENT UP,
SOME BOOKS (DEFAMING CERTAIN ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS) CONTINUED
TO BE BANNED HERE. IT WAS FELT THAT THEY INJURED THE SENSIBILITIES OF THESE

GROUPS AND PRESENTED A FALSE IMAGE WHICH COULD PROMOTE FEELINGS OF 
HATE TOWARDS THESE GROUPS. FOR MUSLIMS THIS KIND OF DOUBLE STANDARD 
WAS ANNOYING.)

RUSHDIE SAW THIS SPOTLIGHT AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO LASH OUT AT
"ORGANIZED"
ISLAM, AND HE DID SO WITH ADMIRABLE VERBAL SKILL. THE ONLY KIND OF ISLAM
WHICH RUSHDIE FINDS PALATABLE IS WHAT HE CALLS A "SECULAR" ISLAM - AN ISLAM
SEPARATED FROM IT'S QUR'AN, IT'S PROPHET, GOD, ITS LEGISLATION, AND MOST
IMPORTANTLY FROM ANY INTRUSION INTO ANY POLITICAL ARENA. FINE - RUSHDIE
MADE
HIS VIEWS KNOWN - THE MUSLIM'S MADE THEIR ANGER AT HIS BOOK KNOWN. THE
SCALE OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR ERUPTED INTO GLOBAL PROPORTIONS - IT WAS, BY THIS
TIME,
ALREADY A POLITICAL SITUATION - AFFECTING GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS
INDIVIDUALS.
THE SITUATION WAS A SERIOUS ONE, WITH FAR-REACHING POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS.
AT THE CENTRE OF THIS TURMOIL WAS RUSHDIE, THROWING FUEL ON THE FIRE -
ENGAGED
IN A PERSONAL CRUSADE THAT
