SO NOTHING.  IT MAY WORK FOR SOME, BUT NOT FOR OTHERS: IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY
INSIGHT INTO AN OVERALL GOD OR OVERALL TRUTH OF A RELIGION- IT WOULD SEEM TO BE
DEPENDENT SOLELY ON THE INDIVIDUAL, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALLY-CREATED.  AND SINCE
CHRISTIANS HAVE FAILED TO SHOW US HOW THERE WAY OF LIFE IS IN ANY WY BETTER
THAN OURS, I DO NOT SEE WHY THE ATTEMPT TO TRY IT IS NECESSARY, OR EVEN
PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE.

WELL, WE WILL NERVER KNOW FOR SURE IF WE WERE TOLD THE TRUTH OR NOT, BUT AT THE
VERY LEAST THERE IS A BIT MORE EVIDENCE POINTING TO THE FACT THAT, SAY, THERE
WAS A MILITARY CONFLICT IN VIETNAM 25 YEARS AGO, THEN THERE IS A SUPERNATURAL
DIETY WHO WANTS US TO LIVE A CERTAIN WAY.  THE FACT THAT JESUS WARNED AGAINST
IT
