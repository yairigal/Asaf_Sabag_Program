CUTE CHARACTERIZATION BILL; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN 
THE TWO STATEMENTS.  EVEN IF ONE BELIEVES THAT RELIGION IS "PRIMITIVE, 
SIMPLE-MINDED AND UNSCIENTIFIC, ANTI-INTELLECTUAL AND CHILDISH", ONE
CAN STILL HOLD THE VIEW THAT RELIGION ALSO ADDS AN UNNECESSARY LEVEL OF
COMPLEXITY TO THE EXPLANATION.  THE IDEAS THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE TO BE
COMPLEX BEFORE BEING EXCISED BY OCCAM'S RAZOR, THEY ONLY HAVE TO ADD 
UNNECESSARILY TO THE OVERALL COMPLEXITY OF THE DESCRIPTION.

I THINK THE NON-ESSENTIAL PART OF AN EXPLANATORY SYSTEM IS ONE THAT
ADDS NO PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY TO THE SYSTEM.
