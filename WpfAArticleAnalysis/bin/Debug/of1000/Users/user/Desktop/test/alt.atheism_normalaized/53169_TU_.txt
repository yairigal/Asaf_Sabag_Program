        THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST SCIENTISTS EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE
        SUPERNATURAL IN THE QUESTION OF ORIGINS.  IS THIS IS A FAIR PREMISE?
        I UTTERLY REJECT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SCIENCE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF
        TRUTH.

        SOME OF THESE SO-CALLED HUMAN-LIKE CREATURES WERE APES.  SOME WERE
        HUMANS.  SOME WERE FANCIFULLY RECONSTRUCTED FROM FRAGMENTS.

           GOOD DEEDS DO NOT JUSTIFY A PERSON IN GOD'S SIGHT.
