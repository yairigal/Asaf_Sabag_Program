                                   OVERVIEW

WELCOME TO ALT.ATHEISM AND ALT.ATHEISM.MODERATED.

THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF REGULAR POSTINGS AIMED AT NEW READERS OF THE
NEWSGROUPS.

MANY GROUPS OF A 'CONTROVERSIAL' NATURE HAVE NOTICED THAT NEW READERS OFTEN
COME UP WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS, MIS-STATEMENTS OR MISCONCEPTIONS AND POST
THEM TO THE NET.  IN ADDITION, PEOPLE OFTEN REQUEST INFORMATION WHICH HAS
BEEN POSTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  IN ORDER TO TRY AND CUT DOWN ON THIS, THE
ALT.ATHEISM GROUPS HAVE A SERIES OF FIVE REGULAR POSTINGS UNDER THE FOLLOWING
TITLES:

   1.  ALT.ATHEISM FAQ: OVERVIEW FOR NEW READERS
   2.  ALT.ATHEISM FAQ: INTRODUCTION TO ATHEISM
   3.  ALT.ATHEISM FAQ: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
   4.  ALT.ATHEISM FAQ: CONSTRUCTING A LOGICAL ARGUMENT
   5.  ALT.ATHEISM FAQ: ATHEIST RESOURCES

THIS IS ARTICLE NUMBER 1.  PLEASE READ NUMBERS 2 AND 3 BEFORE POSTING.  THE
OTHERS ARE ENTIRELY OPTIONAL.

IF YOU ARE NEW TO USENET, YOU MAY ALSO FIND IT HELPFUL TO READ THE NEWSGROUP
NEWS.ANNOUNCE.NEWUSERS.  THE ARTICLES TITLED "A PRIMER ON HOW TO WORK WITH
THE USENET COMMUNITY", "ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT USENET"
AND "HINTS ON WRITING STYLE FOR USENET" ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT.  QUESTIONS
CONCERNING HOW NEWS WORKS ARE BEST ASKED IN NEWS.NEWUSERS.QUESTIONS.

IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO FIND ANY OF THE ARTICLES LISTED ABOVE, SEE THE "FINDING
STUFF" SECTION BELOW.
