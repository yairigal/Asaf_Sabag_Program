This is becoming a tiresome statement  Coming from you it is  
a definition not an assertion 
 
   Islam is good  Belief in Islam is good  Therefore being a  
   believer in Islam can produce only goodbecause Islam is 
   good Blah blah blah 
 
Thats about as circular as it gets and equally meaningless  To 
say that something produces only good because it is only good that  
it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition  And 
all youre application is saying that its true if you really  
believe its true  Thats silly 
 
Conversely you say offhandedly that anything can happen under 
atheism  Again just an offshoot of believeitanditbecomestrue 
dontbelieveitanditdoesnt   
 
Like other religions Im aquainted with Islam teaches exclusion and 
caste and suggests harsh penalties for behaviors that have no 
logical call for punishment certain limits on speech and sex for 
example  To me this is not good  I see much pain and suffering 
without any justification except for the waving of the hand of 
some inaccessible god 
 
By the by you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly 
For what is a knowledgeable believer except a contradiction of 
terms  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith 
And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing 
to do with it does it
