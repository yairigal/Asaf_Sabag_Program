IT IS GOOD TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE A FEW REASONABLE CHRISTIANS ABOUT.
IF ONLY THOSE CHRISTIAN "SCIENTISTS" WOULD TAKE NOTE.

(IN AUSTRALIA THERE IS A VERY STRONG MOVEMENT, A BUNCH OF CHRISTIAN 
SCIENTISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE EVENT IN THE BIBLE IS EXACTLY
TRUE, AND THAT THERE IS A RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR IT ALL THAT CAN BE JUSTIFIED
BY USING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE A FEW CHAPS WHO ARE 
TRYING TO PROVE THAT THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE IS 6000 YEARS OLD, AND THAT THE
ERROR IN CONVENTIONAL CALCULATIONS IS THE RESULT OF THE FACT THAT THE SPEED 
LIGHT HAS BEEN RAPIDLY DECAYING OVER THE YEARS, AND THIS HAS NOT BEEN 
ACCOUNTED FOR. :-] )

>	THE BOOK SAYS THAT JESUS WAS EITHER A LIAR, OR HE WAS CRAZY ( A 
>MODERN DAY KORESH) OR HE WAS ACTUALLY WHO HE SAID HE WAS.

OR (OF COURSE), THAT HE NEVER EXISTED, AND THE BIBLE WAS A STORY, AND WAS NEVER 
INTENDED TO BECOME A MANIFESTO FOR A BILLION PEOPLE.  DID TONY FOLLOW THAT ONE
UP?

MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE "DIED FOR A LIE".  THIS  POINT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SUBSTANTIATE SINCE IT IS NOT WELL DEFINED (A GREAT MANY RELIGIOUS ARGUMENTS
WORK IN THAT WAY), BUT CONSIDER THE MANY AZTEC WARRIORS WHO SACRIFICED 
THEMSELVES TO THEIR GODS IN THE BELIEF THAT THIS ACT WOULD BRING THEM VICTORY
OF THE SPANISH INVADERS.  THE LIST IS ENDLESS.  THE AZTECS LOST, BTW.

>CALL ME A FOOL, BUT I BELIEVE HE DID HEAL PEOPLE.
  
THAT IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE, BUT IT IS NOT GROUNDS FOR ME (OR ANYONE)
TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN.  MORE TO THE POINT, IT DOES NOT ADD WEIGHT TO
THE CLAIM THAT JESUS WAS THE "REAL THING".
