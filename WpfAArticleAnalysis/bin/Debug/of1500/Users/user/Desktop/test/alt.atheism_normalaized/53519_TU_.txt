  THE RECENT RISE OF NOSTALGIA IN THIS GROUP, COMBINED WITH THE
  INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF UTTER BULLSHIT, HAS PROMPTED ME TO COMB
  THROUGH MY ARCHIVES AND PULL OUT SOME OF "THE BEST OF ALT.ATHEISM"
  FOR YOUR READING PLEASURE.  I'LL POST A COUPLE OF THESE A DAY
  UNLESS GROUP CONCENSUS DEMANDS THAT I STOP, OR I RUN OUT OF GOOD
  MATERIAL.

  I HAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY CAREFUL IN THE PAST ABOUT SAVING
  ATTRIBUTIONS.  I THINK THE FOLLOWING COMES FROM JOHN A. JOHNSON,
  BUT SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.  THIS IS PROBABLY THE LONGEST
  OF MY ENTIRE COLLECTION.

                                  SO THAT THE
                                  PROPHECY BE
                                   FULFILLED

                                     * * *

       IN CONSIDERING THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, AND JUDGING IT
ACCORDING TO ITS CLAIMS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT ITS CLAIMS AT
FULFILLING EARLIER JEWISH PROPHECY.  THE SCRIBE MATTHEW IS PERHAPS
THE MOST EAGER TO DRAW OUT WHAT HE THINKS ARE PROPHETIC ANSWERS IN
THE CAREER OF JESUS OF NAZARETH.  AS YOU WILL SEE, MATTHEW'S MAIN
STRATEGY IS TO TAKE VARIOUS OLD TESTAMENT PASSAGES, OFTEN NOT EVEN
ABOUT THE PROMISED MESSIAH, AND APPLY THEM TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
THE NEW TESTAMENT.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THE QUESTION OF THE
AUTHENTICITY OF THE ACCOUNTS.  SINCE THE GOSPELS WERE WRITTEN AT
LEAST 35 YEARS AFTER JESUS WAS EXECUTED, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH
HAPPENED EXACTLY AS STATED.  BUT, FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS, WE
WILL TAKE PARTICULAR CLAIMS AT FACE VALUE.

IMMANUEL:

       WE BEGIN, OF COURSE, AT THE BEGINNING.

       (MT 1.21-22):  "[MARY] WILL BEAR A SON, AND YOU,
       JOSEPH, WILL NAME HIM 'JESUS' (WHICH MEANS G'D IS
       SALVATION), FOR HE WILL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
       SINS."  ALL THIS HAPPENED TO FULFIL WHAT THE LORD HAD
       SPOKEN BY A PROPHET:

       [ISAIAH 7.1-16]:  IN THE DAYS OF AHAZ (C. 750 BCE),
       KING OF JUDAH, REZIN OF SYRIA AND PEKAH OF ISRAEL MADE
       WAR ON JERUSALEM (CAPITOL OF JUDAH), BUT COULD NOT
       QUITE CONQUER IT.  WHEN THE HOUSE OF DAVID (I.E. AHAZ
       AND HIS COURT IN JUDAH) WERE TOLD OF THIS, ...ITS
       HEART AND THE HEART OF ITS PEOPLE SHOOK...   AND, THE
       LORD G'D SAID TO ISAIAH, "GO TO MEET WITH AHAZ..." 
       ...AND THE LORD SPOKE TO AHAZ (THROUGH PROPHET ISAIAH,
       NATURALLY) SAYING, "ASK A SIGN OF G'D YOUR LORD.  IT
       CAN BE AS DEEP AS SHEOL OR AS HIGH AS HEAVEN."  BUT,
       AHAZ SAID, "I WON'T ASK; I WILL NOT PUT THE LORD TO A
       TEST."  THEN (ISAIAH) SAID, "HEAR THEN, O HOUSE OF
       DAVID.  IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO WEARY MEN, THAT
       YOU MUST WEARY MY GOD TOO?  THEREFORE, THE LORD
       HIMSELF WILL GIVE YOU A SIGN:  BEHOLD, A YOUNG WOMAN
       IS WITH CHILD AND WILL BEAR A SON, AND NAME HIM
       "IMMANUEL," WHICH MEANS, "G'D IS WITH US."   HE WILL
       EAT CURDS AND HONEY WHEN HE KNOWS HOW TO REFUSE EVIL
       AND CHOOSE GOOD.  FOR, BEFORE THE CHILD KNOWS HOW TO
       REFUSE EVIL AND CHOOSE GOOD, THE LAND OF THE TWO KINGS
       YOU DREAD WILL HAVE BEEN DESERTED...

MATTHEW HOMES IN ON JUST THE SENTENCE THAT IS IN ITALICS. 
FURTHER, HE THE HEBREW WORD "ALMAH," (YOUNG WOMAN), AS
SPECIFICALLY, "VIRGIN."  BUT, THIS IS NOT A PROPHECY ABOUT THE
MESSIAH.  IT IS NOT A PROPHECY ABOUT AN EVENT TO HAPPEN 750 YEARS
LATER.  IT IS NOT A PROPHECY ABOUT A VIRGIN (BETHULAH) MOTHER.  IN
SHORT, IT NOT ABOUT JESUS.  MATTHEW HAS MADE USE OF A VERSE OUT OF
CONTEXT, AND TRIES TO MAKE IT FIT THE SPECIFIC CASE OF MARY.  IT
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IF WE WANT TO READ THE PROPHECY IN A GENERAL
MANNER, A VERY GENERAL ONE, IT CAN BE MADE TO FIT MARY.  MARY,
VIRGIN OR NOT, WAS INDEED A YOUNG WOMAN WITH CHILD.  OF COURSE,
THE FIT IS SHADY AND HAS PROBLEMS.  JESUS, WHILE THOUGHT OF BY
LATER CHRISTIANS TO BE G'D WALKING AMONG MEN, WAS NEVER CALLED BY
THE NAME, IMMANUEL.  IF CHRISTIANITY WISHED TO CLAIM THIS PROPHECY
FOR JESUS, IT BECOMES AT BEST A CUT-AND-PASTE PROPHECY... A SECOND
CLASS PROPHECY.   NOT TOO CONVINCING.

EGYPT:

       AFTER JESUS'S BIRTH IN BETHLEHEM, MATTHEW TELLS ABOUT A
QUICK (AND ELSEWHERE UNMENTIONED) EXCURSION TO EGYPT, AS IF HE
WISHES TO LIKEN JESUS TO MOSES.  THIS WAS DONE TO ESCAPE AN
ALLEGED INFANTICIDAL RAMPAGE OF THE KING, HEROD.

       [MT 2.15]  ...AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE DEATH OF
       HEROD.  THIS WAS TO FULFIL WHAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN:
       "OUT OF EGYPT I HAVE CAL-LED MY SON."


WHAT THE LORD REALLY SAID WAS THIS.

       [HOSEA 11.1]  WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD, I LOVED HIM. 
       AND, OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON.  THE MORE I CALLED
       THEM (MY PEOPLE), THE MORE THEY WENT FROM ME; THEY
       KEPT SACRIFICING TO THE BA'ALS, AND KEPT BURNING
       INCENSE TO IDOLS.

MATTHEW CONVENIENTLY OMITS THE REST OF HOSEA'S ORACLE.  BUT, IT
WAS INDEED ISRAEL THAT, ONCE CALLED OUT OF EGYPT, WANTED TO
RETURN.  THIS IS HISTORY.  JESUS IS CERTAINLY NOT BEING SPOKEN OF
HERE.  AND, IF WE ARE TO DRAW SOME KIND OF PARALLEL HERE, WE WIND
UP WITH A JESUS THAT FLEES AND RESISTS G'D.   AGAIN, THIS PROPHECY
IS JUST NOT AS CONVINCING AS MATTHEW PROBABLY HAD HOPED.

RACHEL WEEPS:

        WHILE JESUS IS OFF VACATIONING IN EGYPT, MATTHEW SAYS THAT
KING HEROD SOUGHT TO KILL HIM, AND THUS ORDERED THE EXECUTIONS OF
ALL YOUNG MALE CHILDREN.  MATTHEW THEN WRITES,

       [MT 2.17-18]   BY THIS, THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE
       PROPHET JEREMIAH WAS FULFILLED:

       "A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WAILING AND LOUD
       LAMENTATION-- RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN;
       SHE REFUSED TO BE CONSOLED, BECAUSE THEY WERE
       NO MORE."   

THE REFERENCE IS TO A PASSAGE IN JEREMIAH 31.15, REFERRING TO THE
CARRYING OFF OF ISRAEL INTO EXILE BY SARGON (OF ASSYRIA) IN 722
BCE.  RACHEL, THE ANCESTOR OF THE MAJOR TRIBES OF ISRAEL, EPHRAIM,
AND MANASSEH, IS SAID TO WEEP FOR HER DESCENDANTS WHO ARE "NO
MORE."  IT IS METAPHORICAL, OF COURSE, SINCE RACHEL LIVED AND DIES
BEFORE THE HEBREWS WERE EVEN IN THE EGYPTIAN EXILE.
       IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IT WAS LEAH, NOT RACHEL, WHO
WAS THE ANCESTOR OF THE JUDEANS (THE LAND WHERE JESUS AND
BETHLEHEM WERE).  IF ANYONE SHOULD DO WEEPING FOR HER "CHILDREN,"
IT IS LEAH.  THE ONLY CONNEXION THAT RACHEL HAS WITH BETHLEHEM IS
THAT THE LEGENDS HAVE IT THAT SHE WAS BURIED NORTH OF THE CITY,
"ON THE WAY TO EPHRATH, (BETHLEHEM)."
