It is all written in TheWhollyBabbletheUsersGuidetoInvisible 
PinkUnicorns 
 
To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns you must read the Babble 
and obey what is written in it 
 
To obey what is written in the Babble you must believe that doing so is 
the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns 
 
To believe that obeying what is written in the Babble leads to believing 
in invisible pink unicorns you must essentially believe in invisible 
pink unicorns 
 
This bit of circular reasoning begs the question 
What makes obeying different from believing
