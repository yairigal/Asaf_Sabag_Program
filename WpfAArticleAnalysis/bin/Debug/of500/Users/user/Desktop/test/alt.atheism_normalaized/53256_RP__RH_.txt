 You know it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing 
 can be blamed solely on Mary 
  
 So shes married to Joseph  She gets knocked up  What do you think 
 ol Joe will do if he finds shes been getting around  So Mary comes up 
 with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant   
  
 
  Nice attempt Chris    verrry close 
 
  You missed the conspiracy by 1 step Joseph knew who knocked her up 
He couldnt let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol Mary prego That 
wouldnt do well for his popularity in the local circles So what  
happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and 
THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise 
been the downfall for both Clever indeed Come to think of it    I 
have gained a new respect for the couple Maybe Joseph and Mary should 
receive all of the praise being paid to jesus
