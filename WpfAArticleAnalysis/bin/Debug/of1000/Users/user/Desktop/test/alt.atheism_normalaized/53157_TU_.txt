  I DOUBT THE DEATH PENALTY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A "DETERRENT" TO CRIME. IF SO,
WHY DOESN'T EVERY CRIME CARRY A DEATH PENALTY ? THAT WOULD BE EFFICTIVE
WOULDN'T IT ???

  THE DEATH PENALTY IS A PUNISHMENT, MUCH LIKE A $50 FINE FOR SPEEDING IS
A PUNISHMENT. ANYWAY, SOMEBODY WITH MURDER ON THE MIND DOESN'T MUCH CARE
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES. I THINK ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE DONT THINK
THEY WILL GET CAUGHT. IF I WANTED TO KILL ANOTHER PERSON, I WOULDN'T 
CARE WHAT THE PENALTY WAS IF I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD GET CAUGHT.

  IF IT WAS TO BE STRICTLY A DETERRENT, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ALONG 
THE LINES OF TORTURE.
