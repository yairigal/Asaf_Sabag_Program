WHAT IS YOUR DEGREE IN AGAIN - OR SHOULD I SAY WHEN.  THIS IS A 1960'S
VIEW OF ABIOGENESIS.  PLEASE READ SOMETHING MODERN LIKE CARLE WOOSE'S
"ON THE ORIGINS" WHICH HE BEATS THESE "WARM LITTLE PONDS" INTO THE GROUND.

LOOK AT ARCHEOBACTERIA - THEY LIVE IN AREAS SO HOT YOU WOULD MELT.  
                        
AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE USE THEIR MACHINERY EVERDAY IN THE PURSUIT OF
NEW DRUGS, THERAPIES, AND KNOWLEDGE.

^^^^^^^^^^^
YOU MEAN YOUR THEORY.  AGAIN, ARGUING THIS POINT IS LIKE TELLING A CHILD
THAT THE SKY WILL NOT FALL.  IF THE CHILD IS STUBBORN YOU WILL NOT GET ANYWHERE.

>WOULD BE LEFT HANDED.

THE P=1.  THEY ARE LEFT HANDED :)  REALLY, THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL.  THERE ARE
MANY PROBLEMS WITH ABIOGENISIS BUT THESE ARE REALLY TRIVIAL.

>JACK
PLEASE JACK RAD SOME MODERN BIOLOLGY - I DO NOT MEAN BOOKS BY CREATIONISTS
ABOUT MODERN BIOLOGY.  PICK UP A TEXT BOOK AND READ.  I THINK YOU
WOULD LIKE WOOSE'S "ON THE ORIGINS."  HE IS AN AROGANT MAN BUT HIS WRITTING
AND RESEARCH IS BRILLIANT.
