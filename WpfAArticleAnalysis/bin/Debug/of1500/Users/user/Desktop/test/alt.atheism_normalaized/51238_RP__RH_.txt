But you havent taken into the account of propoganda  Remember if you 
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered they would 
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at 
least some were able to tolerate it 
 
You see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general 
frenzy

Well they havent managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity 
of the courts  But they have managed to create quite a few problems for 
people that wanted to have an abortion  They could create similar problems 
for us  And it could be worse  They can try to stop abortions by blocking 
clinics etc but imagine what theyd have to do to stop atheism

So you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a

Yes Id be glad if it were gone to  Ive never supported it  However 
I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted 
with what *could* happen an what may be likely

Well I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key the 
motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed 
in a god  And surely there are a few Christians that think as you say 
but I dont think that most do  Do you think that all Christians actively 
despise other religions  Most that I have met havent and dont do so 
 
>>>No christian 
>>>that I have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them 
>>Why not ask some people of other faiths 
>Sorry I would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here 
>Suppose you could ask a few people 
 
Well I have asked a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of them think 
that it is applicable to them  Of course I cant say that these people 
just some that I know pretty well are accurate representations of their 
faiths

Well Id really like to and Ive tried but I really dont know where to 
get access to Congressional Records from the 1950s  Can anyone help 
out here

Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs

So are you saying that they redesign the plates each year 
 
Anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted I see was that the motto 
somehow costs us all a lot of money  This is just not correct

>How could it be between religious and not religious The motto

That is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of 
the USSR  That was what most of those quotes were about and some included 
all atheists in general as well  I dont think that any of the quotes 
although I seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about Jesus 
They advocated religion over nonreligion  A specific religion was not 
mentioned 
 
>>You have missed this point  I said that the motto didnt say anything 
>>about anyone in particular  That is the motto doesnt imply anything 
>>about *your* particular beliefs  It doesnt say that everyone trusts

So you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions 
should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong  Thats silly 
I think the FlatEarthers are wrong but I dont advocate their banishment 
 
>  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would 
>even be incurred by removing the motto Provide some evidence for your 
>claim that it would 
 
I think that any such cost would be insignificant  I mentioned the slight 
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by 
being on our currency 
 
>Disregarding the digression of the other mottoIf it is used for 
>harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should 
>it not be removed 
 
Well mottos in general dont really have purposes  I dont think it 
should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the 
consequences 
 
>>And do you know what the vote was  Were there other opinions  Do you
