      In the deletions somewhere it mentioned something about chopping 
off of hands being a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia Assuming this 
is so I wouldnt know and assuming it is done by people fitting your 
requirement for muslim which I find highly likely then would you 
please try to convince Bobby Mozumder that muslims chop peoples hands 
off 
 
      Come back when youve succeeded
