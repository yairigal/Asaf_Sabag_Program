From Free Inquiry Winter 8384  the following is an 
introduction to the article Joseph Smith and the Book of 
Mormon by George D Smith  The introduction is written by 
Paul Kurtz  
 
	Mormonism  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints 
	 claims a worldwide membership 52 million  It is one of 
	the worlds fastest growing religions with as many as 
	200000 new converst in 1982 alone  Because of the churchs 
	aggressive missionary program covering more than one 
	hundred countries it is spreading even to third world 
	countries 
	 
	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and 
	evangelical in preachment  The church is run along strict 
	authoritarian lines  Led by a president who allegedly 
	receives revelations directly form God and a group of 
	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief 
	and practice the church is opposed to abortion 
	pornography sexual freedom womens rights and other in 
	its view immoral influences of secular society and it 
	forbids the use of tobacco alcohol coffee and tea 
	 
	Centered in Salt Lake City the church is extremely wealthy 
	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western 
	states  Among wellknow presentday Mormons are Ezra Taft 
	Benson former secretary of agriculture the Osmond family 
	the Mariotts of the hotel empire and a score of highplaced 
	government officials 
	 
	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by 
	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had 
	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill 
	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he 
	had been able to translate the writing into the Book of 
	Mormon the basis of Mormon belief  This book written by 
	the commandment of God claims that the ancient Hebrews 
	settled in America about 600 BCE and were the ancestors 
	of the American Indians  Mormons believe that those who 
	have been baptized in the true church will be reunited 
	after death and that deceased nonMormon family members can 
	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the 
	hereafter  Because of
