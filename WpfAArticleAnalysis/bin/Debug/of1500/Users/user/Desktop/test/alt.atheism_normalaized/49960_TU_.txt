                               BOOKS -- FICTION

THOMAS M. DISCH

"THE SANTA CLAUS COMPROMISE"
SHORT STORY.  THE ULTIMATE PROOF THAT SANTA EXISTS.  ALL CHARACTERS AND 
EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS.  ANY SIMILARITY TO LIVING OR DEAD GODS -- UH, WELL...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

"A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ"
ONE GEM IN THIS POST ATOMIC DOOMSDAY NOVEL IS THE MONKS WHO SPENT THEIR LIVES
COPYING BLUEPRINTS FROM "SAINT LEIBOWITZ", FILLING THE SHEETS OF PAPER WITH
INK AND LEAVING WHITE LINES AND LETTERS.

EDGAR PANGBORN

"DAVY"
POST ATOMIC DOOMSDAY NOVEL SET IN CLERICAL STATES.  THE CHURCH, FOR EXAMPLE,
FORBIDS THAT ANYONE "PRODUCE, DESCRIBE OR USE ANY SUBSTANCE CONTAINING...
ATOMS". 

PHILIP K. DICK

PHILIP K. DICK DICK WROTE MANY PHILOSOPHICAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING SHORT 
STORIES AND NOVELS.  HIS STORIES ARE BIZARRE AT TIMES, BUT VERY APPROACHABLE.
HE WROTE MAINLY SF, BUT HE WROTE ABOUT PEOPLE, TRUTH AND RELIGION RATHER THAN
TECHNOLOGY.  ALTHOUGH HE OFTEN BELIEVED THAT HE HAD MET SOME SORT OF GOD, HE
REMAINED SCEPTICAL.  AMONGST HIS NOVELS, THE FOLLOWING ARE OF SOME RELEVANCE:

"GALACTIC POT-HEALER"
A FALLIBLE ALIEN DEITY SUMMONS A GROUP OF EARTH CRAFTSMEN AND WOMEN TO A
REMOTE PLANET TO RAISE A GIANT CATHEDRAL FROM BENEATH THE OCEANS.  WHEN THE
DEITY BEGINS TO DEMAND FAITH FROM THE EARTHERS, POT-HEALER JOE FERNWRIGHT IS
UNABLE TO COMPLY.  A POLISHED, IRONIC AND AMUSING NOVEL.

"A MAZE OF DEATH"
NOTEWORTHY FOR ITS DESCRIPTION OF A TECHNOLOGY-BASED RELIGION.

"VALIS"
THE SCHIZOPHRENIC HERO SEARCHES FOR THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF GNOSTIC
CHRISTIANITY AFTER REALITY IS FIRED INTO HIS BRAIN BY A PINK LASER BEAM OF
UNKNOWN BUT POSSIBLY DIVINE ORIGIN.  HE IS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DOGMATIC AND
DISMISSIVELY ATHEIST FRIEND AND ASSORTED OTHER ODD CHARACTERS.

"THE DIVINE INVASION"
GOD INVADES EARTH BY MAKING A YOUNG WOMAN PREGNANT AS SHE RETURNS FROM
ANOTHER STAR SYSTEM.  UNFORTUNATELY SHE IS TERMINALLY ILL, AND MUST BE
ASSISTED BY A DEAD MAN WHOSE BRAIN IS WIRED TO 24-HOUR EASY LISTENING MUSIC.

MARGARET ATWOOD

"THE HANDMAID'S TALE"
A STORY BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THE US CONGRESS IS MYSTERIOUSLY
ASSASSINATED, AND FUNDAMENTALISTS QUICKLY TAKE CHARGE OF THE NATION TO SET IT
"RIGHT" AGAIN.  THE BOOK IS THE DIARY OF A WOMAN'S LIFE AS SHE TRIES TO LIVE
UNDER THE NEW CHRISTIAN THEOCRACY.  WOMEN'S RIGHT TO OWN PROPERTY IS REVOKED,
AND THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS ARE CLOSED; SINFUL LUXURIES ARE OUTLAWED, AND THE
RADIO IS ONLY USED FOR READINGS FROM THE BIBLE.  CRIMES ARE PUNISHED
RETROACTIVELY: DOCTORS WHO PERFORMED LEGAL ABORTIONS IN THE "OLD WORLD" ARE
HUNTED DOWN AND HANGED.  ATWOOD'S WRITING STYLE IS DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO
AT FIRST, BUT THE TALE GROWS MORE AND MORE CHILLING AS IT GOES ON.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

"THE BIBLE"
THIS SOMEWHAT DULL AND RAMBLING WORK HAS OFTEN BEEN CRITICIZED.  HOWEVER, IT
IS PROBABLY WORTH READING, IF ONLY SO THAT YOU'LL KNOW WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS
ABOUT.  IT EXISTS IN MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS, SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ONE
TRUE VERSION.

                             BOOKS -- NON-FICTION

PETER DE ROSA

"VICARS OF CHRIST", BANTAM PRESS, 1988

DROEMER-KNAUR, 1989)

AREA.  ARGUES BOTH FOR "NEGATIVE ATHEISM" (I.E. THE "NON-BELIEF IN THE
EXISTENCE OF GOD(S)") AND ALSO FOR "POSITIVE ATHEISM" ("THE BELIEF IN THE
NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD(S)").  INCLUDES GREAT REFUTATIONS OF THE MOST
CHALLENGING ARGUMENTS FOR GOD; PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO REFUTING
CONTEMPORY THEISTS SUCH AS PLATINGA AND SWINBURNE.

 MD, USA

UNBELIEF (WHETHER AGNOSTIC OR ATHEISTIC)  BECAME A MAINSTREAM ALTERNATIVE
WORLD-VIEW.  FOCUSSES ON THE PERIOD 1770-1900, AND WHILE CONSIDERING FRANCE
