I'M NOT SAYING THIS AT ALL - IT REQUIRES NO FAITH ON MY PART TO
SAY THE CAR DRIVES BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT DRIVE - I'VE DONE MORE
THAN AT IN FACT - I'VE ACTUALLY DRIVEN IT. (NOW WHAT DOES REQUIRE
SOME FAITH IS THE BELIEF THAT MY SENSES GIVE AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION
OF WHAT'S OUT THERE....) BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE - PRO OR CON -
FOR THE EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD (SEE WHAT I HAVE TO
SAY BELOW ON THIS).

SORRY IF I REMAIN SKEPTICAL - I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ENTIRELY A
CONCLUSION. THAT YOU HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A GOD
IS CORRECT - NEITHER HAVE I. BUT LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE 
OF SOMETHING IS IN NO WAY EVIDENCE FOR THE NON-EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING 
(THE CREATIONIST HAVE A SIMILAR MODE OF ARGUMENTATION IN WHICH IF THEY 
DISPROVE EVOLUTION THE ESTABLISH CREATION). YOU (PERSONALLY) HAVE NEVER 
SEEN A NEUTRINO BEFORE, BUT THEY EXIST. THE "PINK UNICORN" ANALOGY BREAKS
DOWN AND IS RATHER NAIVE. I HAVE A SCIENTIFIC THEORY THAT EXPLAINS THE 
APPEARANCE OF ANIMAL LIFE - EVOLUTION. WHEN I DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT 
"PINK UNICORNS" DON'T EXIST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM, THIS CONCLUSION
HAS IT'S FOUNDATION IN OBSERVATION AND THEORY. A "PINK UNICORN", IF
IT DID EXIST, WOULD BE QUALITATIVELY SIMILAR TO OTHER KNOWN ENTITIES.
THAT IS TO SAY, SINCE THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE THAT ALL LIFE ON EARTH HAS
EVOLVED FROM "MORE PRIMITIVE" ANCESTORS THESE PINK UNICORNS WOULD SHARE 
A COMMON ANSCESTORY WITH HORSES AND ZEBRAS AND SUCH. GOD, HOWEVER,
HAS NO SUCH CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANYTHING (IMO). THERE IS NO PHYSICAL
FRAME WORK OF OBSERVATION TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM.
