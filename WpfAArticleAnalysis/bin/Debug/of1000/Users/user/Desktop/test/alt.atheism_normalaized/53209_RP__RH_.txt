But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way 
and I dont think youve even noticed 
 
In another part of this thread youve been telling us that the 
goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive 
 
But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long 
term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some  
other species either terrestrial or alien 
 
Does that make it moral to do so
