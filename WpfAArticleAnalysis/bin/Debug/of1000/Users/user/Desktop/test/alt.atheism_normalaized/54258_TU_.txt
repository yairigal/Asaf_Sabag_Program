BR>        SINCE YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE MESSIAH, I ASSUME YOU
BR> ARE REFERRING         TO THE NEW TESTAMENT.  PLEASE DETAIL
BR> YOUR COMPLAINTS OR E-MAIL IF         YOU DON'T WANT TO POST.
BR>  FIRST-CENTURY GREEK IS WELL-KNOWN AND        
BR> WELL-UNDERSTOOD.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOSEPHUS, THE JEWISH
BR> HISTORIAN,         WHO ALSO WROTE OF JESUS?  IN ADDITION,
BR> THE FOUR GOSPEL ACCOUNTS		 ARE VERY MUCH IN HARMONY.

IT IS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE COMMENTS IN JOSEPHUS RELATING TO JESUS WERE
INSERTED (BADLY) BY LATER EDITORS.  AS FOR THE FOUR GOSPELS BEING IN HARMONY
ON THE ISSUE OF JESUS...  YOU KNOW NOT OF WHAT YOU SPEAK.  HERE ARE A FEW
CONTRADICTIONS STARTING WITH THE TRIAL AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE ASSENSION.

>THE DEATH OF JUDAS AFTER THE BETRAYAL OF JESUS

ACTS 1:18: "NOW THIS MAN (JUDAS) PURCHASED A FIELD WITH THE REWARD OF 
INIQUITY; AND FALLING HEADLONG, HE BURST ASUNDER IN THE MIDST, AND ALL HIS 
BOWELS GUSHED OUT."

MATT. 27:5-7: "AND HE (JUDAS) CAST DOWN THE PIECES OF SILVER IN THE TEMPLE, 
AND DEPARTED, AND WENT AND HANGED HIMSELF.  AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS...BOUGHT 
WITH THEM THE POTTER'S FIELD."

>WHAT WAS JESUS' PREDICTION REGARDING PETER'S DENIAL?

BEFORE THE COCK CROW - MATTHEW 26:34

BEFORE THE COCK CROW TWICE - MARK 14:30

>HOW MANY TIMES DID THE COCK CROW?

MAR 14:72  AND THE SECOND TIME THE COCK CREW. AND PETER CALLED TO MIND  THE 
WORD  THAT  JESUS  SAID UNTO HIM, BEFORE THE COCK CROW TWICE, THOU SHALT DENY
ME THRICE. AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEREON, HE WEPT.

MAT 26:74  THEN BEGAN HE TO CURSE AND TO SWEAR,  SAYING,  I  KNOW NOT THE MAN.
AND IMMEDIATELY THE COCK CREW.
MAT 26:75  AND PETER REMEMBERED THE WORD  OF  JESUS,  WHICH  SAID UNTO HIM,
BEFORE THE COCK CROW, THOU SHALT DENY ME THRICE. AND HE WENT OUT, AND WEPT
BITTERLY.

LUK 22:60  AND PETER SAID, MAN, I KNOW NOT WHAT THOU SAYEST.  AND IMMEDIATELY,
WHILE HE YET SPAKE, THE COCK CREW.
LUK 22:61  AND THE LORD TURNED, AND LOOKED UPON PETER. AND  PETER REMEMBERED
THE WORD OF THE LORD, HOW HE HAD SAID UNTO HIM, BEFORE THE COCK CROW, THOU
SHALT DENY ME THRICE.

JOH 13:38  JESUS ANSWERED HIM, WILT THOU LAY DOWN THY LIFE FOR MY SAKE? 
VERILY,
 VERILY, I SAY UNTO THEE, THE COCK SHALL NOT CROW, STILL THOU HAST DENIED ME
THRICE.

JOH 18:27  PETER THEN DENIED  AGAIN:  AND  IMMEDIATELY  THE  COCK CREW.

>DESTRUCTION OF CITIES (WHAT SAID WAS JEREMIAH WAS ZECHARIAH)

(THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE MATTHEW QUOTES A PROPHESY THAT WAS NEVER MADE! 
NOT THE ONLY TIME HE DOES THIS EITHER...)

MAT 27:9  THEN WAS FULFILLED THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY JEREMY  THE PROPHET, 
SAYING,  AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF HIM THAT WAS
VALUED, WHOM THEY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID VALUE;

ZECHARIAH 11:11-13
(NOTHING IN JEREMIAH REMOTELY LIKE)

WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE ROBE PLACED ON JESUS DURING HIS TRIAL?

SCARLET - MATTHEW 27:28

PURPLE JOHN 19:2

>THE TIME OF THE CRUCIFICTION

MARK SAYS THE THIRD HOUR, OR 9 A.M., BUT JOHN SAYS THE SIXTH HOUR (NOON) WAS
WHEN THE SENTENCE WAS PASSED.

>INSCRIPTION ON THE CROSS

MATTHEW  --  THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
MARK	 --  THE KING OF THE JEWS
LUKE	 --  THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
JOHN	 --  JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS

>WHAT DID THEY GIVE HIM TO DRINK?

VINEGAR - MATTHEW 27:34

WINE WITH MYRRH - MARK 15:23

>WOMEN AT THE CROSS

MATTHEW SAID MANY STOOD FAR OFF, INCLUDING MARY MAGDALINE, MARY THE MOTHER OF
JAMES, AND THE MOTHER OF ZEBEDEE'S CHILDREN.  MARK AND LUKE SPEAK OF MANY FAR
OFF, AND MARK INCLUDES MARY MAGDELINE AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JAMES THE LESS.
JOHN SAYS THAT JESUS'S MOTHER STOOD AT THE CROSS, ALONG WITH HER SISTER AND
MARY MAGDALENE.

>JESUS' LAST WORDS 

MATT.27:46,50: "AND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE, 
SAYING, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" THAT IS TO SAY, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY
HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?"  ...JESUS, WHEN HE CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE,
YIELDED U THE GHOST."

LUKE23:46: "AND WHEN JESUS HAD CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE, HE SAID, "FATHER, UNTO
 THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT:" AND HAVING SAID THUS, HE GAVE UP THE GHOST."

JOHN19:30: "WHEN JESUS THEREFORE HAD RECEIVED THE VINEGAR, HE SAID, "IT IS 
FINISHED:" AND HE BOWED HIS HEAD, AND GAVE UP THE GHOST."

>EVENTS OF THE CRUCIFICTION

MATTHEW SAYS THAT THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT, THAT THERE WAS AN
EARTHQUAKE, AND THAT IT WAS DARK FROM THE SIXTH TO THE NINTH HOUR, THAT GRAVES
OPENED AND BODIES OF THE SAINTS AROSE AND WENT INTO JERUSELEM, APPEARING TO
MANY (BEATING JESUS TO THE RESURECTION). MARK AND LUKE SPEAK OF DARKNESS AND
THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE BEING RENT BUT MENTION NO EARTHQUAKE OR RISEN SAINTS. 
JOHN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO MENTIONS JESUS'S SIDE BEING PEIRCED.

>BURIAL OF JESUS

MATTHEW SAYS THE JEWS ASKED PILATE FOR A GUARD TO PREVENT THE BODY FROM BEING
STOLEN BY THE DISCIPLES, AND FOR THE TOMB TO BE SEALED. ALL OF THIS WAS
SUPPOSEDLY DONE, BUT THE OTHER GOSPELS DO NOT MENTION THESE PRECAUTIONS.

>HOW LONG WAS JESUS IN THE TOMB?
DEPENDS WHERE YOU LOOK; MATTHEW 12:40 GIVES JESUS PROPHESYING THAT HE WILL
SPEND "THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH", AND MARK 10:34
HAS "AFTER THREE DAYS (META TREIS EMERAS) HE WILL RISE AGAIN". AS FAR AS I CAN
SEE FROM A QUICK LOOK, THE PROPHECIES HAVE "AFTER THREE DAYS", BUT THE
POST-RESURRECTION NARRATIVES HAVE "ON THE THIRD DAY".

>TIME OF THE RESURECTION

MATTHEW SAYS SUNDAY AT DAWN, MARK SAYS THE SUN WAS RISING, AND JOHN SAYS IT
WAS DARK.

> WHO WAS AT THE EMPTY TOMB?  IS IT :

MAT 28:1  IN THE END OF THE SABBATH, AS IT BEGAN
