Wow youre quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the 
Middle ages Seriously though even the Sheiks at AlAzhar dont 
claim that the Shiites are heretics Most of the accusations 
and fabrications about Shiites come out of Saudi Arabia from the 
Wahabis For that matter you should read the original works of 
the Sunni Imams Imams of the four madhabs The teacher of 
at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq the sixth Imam of the 
Shiites  
 
Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around 
about the Shiites esp since the revolution there are also 
many good works by Shiites which present the views and teachings 
of their school Why make assumptions and allegations like 
people in this group have done about Islam in general about Shiites
