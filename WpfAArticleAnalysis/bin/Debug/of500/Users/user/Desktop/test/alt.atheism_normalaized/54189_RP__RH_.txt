I am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you 
phrase the question makes it unanswerable  The concepts of right 
and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the 
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions  It makes no 
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is 
legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position 
 
Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives 
of epistemology and ethics  perception and motivation respectively 
One can certainly ask if a percept is right correct true 
veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory  But it makes little 
sense to ask if a motive is true or false  On the other hand it is 
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can 
certainly ask that question about motives 
 
Therefore your suggested answers ac simply cant be considered 
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment 
 
Now the problem with d is that it is doublebarrelled  I agree with 
the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a 
meaningless question for the reasons stated above  But that is 
irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that 
one cannot feel peace is better than war  I certainly can make 
value judgments bad better best without asserting the correctness 
of the position 
 
Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ad  My short e answer is 
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on
