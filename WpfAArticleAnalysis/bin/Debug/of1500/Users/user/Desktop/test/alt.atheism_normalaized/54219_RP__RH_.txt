	That is not an atheism mythology in any sense of the word 
Religious paradoy would be significantly more appropriate 
 
	The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I 
do know several strong atheists I am sure that others do I myself am 
strong in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any 
meaning Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of  
the viability of language or in internal self contradiction  
 
	The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy They  
and I exist 
 
	Your strawman is pointless and weak
