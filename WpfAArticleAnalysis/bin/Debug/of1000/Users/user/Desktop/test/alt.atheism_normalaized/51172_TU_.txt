IT AMAZES ME THAT YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT HUMAN CREATION WAS NOT
THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL PROCESS OF EVOLUTION (BUT RATHER AN "ACT OF GOD")
AND THEN IN THE SAME POST SAY THAT THESE OTHER PROCESSES (VOLCANOS ET AL.)
ARE NATURAL OCCURRENCES.  WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT THINGS ARE
NATURAL PROCESSES AND WHAT ARE DIRECT ACTS OF GOD?  HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
GOD DOESN'T CAUSE EACH AND EVERY NATURAL DISASTER WITH A SPECIFIC PURPOSE
IN MIND?  IT WOULD CERTAINLY GO ALONG WITH THE SADISTIC NATURE I'VE SEEN IN
THE BIBLE.

ADAM & EVE (TWO PEOPLE), EVEN THO THEY HAD THE HONOR (OR SO YOU CHRISTIANS
CLAIM) OF BEING THE FIRST TWO, DEFINITELY DO NOT REPRESENT A MAJORITY IN
THE BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS (PROBABLY MORE) OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME AFTER
THEM.  PERHAPS THEY WERE THE MAJORITY THEN, BUT *I* (AND YOU) WEREN'T
AROUND TO VOTE, AND PERHAPS WE MIGHT HAVE VOTED DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT TO
DO WITH THAT TREE.  BUT YOUR GOD NEVER ASKED US.  HE JUST ASSUMES THAT IF
YOU HAVE TWO BAD PEOPLE THEN THEY ALL MUST BE BAD.  HMM.  SOUNDS LIKE THE
SAME KIND OF FALSE GENERALIZATION THAT I SEE MANY OF THE THEISTS POSTING
HERE RESORTING TO.  SO THAT'S WHERE THEY GET IT... SHOULDA KNOWN.
