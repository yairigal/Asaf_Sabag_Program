I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT A POLL DONE OF STUDENTS AT THE IVY LEAGUE
SCHOOLS IN WHICH IT WAS REPORTED THAT A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS
INDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS ATHEISTS.  THIS IS A LOT HIGHER THAN AMONG THE
GENERAL POPULATION.  I WONDER WHAT THE REASONS FOR THIS DISCREPANCY ARE?
IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE INTELLIGENT?  YOUNGER?  IS THIS THE WAVE OF
THE FUTURE?
