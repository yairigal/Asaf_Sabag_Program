THANK YOU.  I NOW KNOW AT LEAST THAT THOUGH I MAY BE ON DRUGS, AT
LEAST I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

YES, THIS TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO -- OF COURSE NOT HAVING AN INDIAN
CONNECTION, NO KNOWLEDGE OF HINDI, ETC., THIS WAS NOT TRIVIAL FOR ME.
I DID HAVE, THANKS TO THE WONDERS OF THE NET, "A GLOSSARY TO *SATANIC
VERSES*", POSTED TO REC.ARTS.BOOKS BY VIJAY RAGHAVAN, WHICH EXPLAINS A
LOT OF THE INDIAN ENGLISH CONSTRUCTIONS, INDIAN CULTURE REFERENCES,
EVEN THE ISLAMIC REFERENCES ("JAHILIA", "SUBMISSION", THE CONTEXT OF
THE SATANIC VERSES INCIDENT, ETC.) -- WHAT I HAVE ONLY COVERS THE
FIRST COUPLE OF HUNDRED PAGES, BUT IT HELPED ME GET INTO THE FLOW OF
THE NOVEL [I CAN MAIL THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED; IF ANYONE HAS
PORTIONS AFTER PART I, IF THEY EXIST, I'D LIKE TO GET THOSE].
