 The willingness of true believers 
 to die for their belief be it in Jesus or Jim Jones is 
 welldocumented so martyrdom in and of itself says little 
 
It does say something about the depth of their belief  Religion has 
both deluded believers and con men  The difference is often how far 
they will follow their beliefs 
 
I have no first hand or even second hand knowledge of how the  
original apostles died  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting 
it for profit and followed that myth to the death that would be 
inconsistent  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would  
lead to discomfort pain and death 
 
The story in 1 Kings regarding the 450 prophets of Baal is of no 
help in this debate  One can easily assume that they believed that 
no overwhelming vindication of Elijah would be forthcoming  He was 
simply a fool who would be shown to be so  The fire from heaven was 
swift and their seizure and deaths were equally swift
