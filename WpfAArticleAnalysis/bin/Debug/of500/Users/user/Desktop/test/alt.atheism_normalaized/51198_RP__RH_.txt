	This is not  strickly correct Only by incorrect application of the  
rules of language does it seem to work 
 
	The Mercedes in the first premis and the one in the second are NOT  
the same Mercedes  
 
	In your case  
 
	A = B 
	C = D 
	 
	A and D are NOT equal One is a name of a person the other the 
name of a object You can not simply extract a word without taking the  
context into account  
 
	Of course your case doesnt imply that A = D 
 
	In his case A does equal D 
 
 
	Try again 
 
 
 
        One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that  
        say Mom because of the love of their mom  It makes for more  
        virile men
