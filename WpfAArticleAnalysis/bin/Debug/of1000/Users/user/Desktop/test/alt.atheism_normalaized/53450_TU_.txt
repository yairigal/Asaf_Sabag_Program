ARE YOU SERIOUS?  TWO STATEMENTS, ONE OF WHICH SAYS THAT USE OF FORCE
IN THE GIVEN SITUATION IS MORAL, AND THE OTHER OF WHICH SAYS IT IS
NOT MORAL "SAY EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING?"

WOULD YOU SAY THIS OF ANY TWO STATEMENTS, ONE SAYING "X IS MORAL" AND
THE OTHER SAYING "X IS IMMORAL?"   HOW WOULD YOU DECIDED WHEN TWO 
STATEMENTS "X IS MORAL" "X IS IMMORAL" ACTUALLY CONFLICT, AND WHEN
THEY "SAY EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING".

THEY MIGHT LEAD YOU TO DO THE SAME THING, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT
MOTIVATES PACIFISM SO THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T LEAD PACIFISTS TO TO THE
SAME THING.
