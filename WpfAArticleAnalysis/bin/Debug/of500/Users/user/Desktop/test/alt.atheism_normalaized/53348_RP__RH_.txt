 But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again 
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict 
 the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
repeatedly You cant repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life So it seems we could never say Thats exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted 
 it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability 
 strictly speaking are lacking 
   
 
	Cant resist because Ive thought about it 
 
	Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis 
There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied for 
the theory to be accurate such as the hotly discussed topic of 
stereoisomerism  Just making life in the lab wouldnt suffice for 
all the wonder that would engender because for the theory of 
abiogenesis to be accurate the life would have to resemble the best 
idea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled 
 
	Comes down to that old question Can we ever really be sure 
 
	But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had been 
demonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed on 
primordial Earth I would look for the following 
 
	1  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earth 
	environment 
 
	2  ALL contamination sources were eliminated 
 
	3  The lifeform produced resembles primitivesimple Earth 
	lifeforms 
 
	4  The theory accounts for differences in the modern 
	Earth environment and primitive Earth environment 
 
NOW if those criteria were satisfied Dr Abio who performed the 
experiment would then be in possession of the best candidate for 
a theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth  At which point Dr 
BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspect 
of the theory which doesnt match the
