      IN THE DELETIONS SOMEWHERE, IT MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT CHOPPING
OFF OF HANDS BEING A PUNISHMENT FOR THEFT IN SAUDI ARABIA. ASSUMING THIS
IS SO (I WOULDN'T KNOW), AND ASSUMING IT IS DONE BY PEOPLE FITTING YOUR
REQUIREMENT FOR "MUSLIM" (WHICH I FIND HIGHLY LIKELY), THEN WOULD YOU
PLEASE TRY TO CONVINCE BOBBY MOZUMDER THAT MUSLIMS CHOP PEOPLE'S HANDS
OFF?

      COME BACK WHEN YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
