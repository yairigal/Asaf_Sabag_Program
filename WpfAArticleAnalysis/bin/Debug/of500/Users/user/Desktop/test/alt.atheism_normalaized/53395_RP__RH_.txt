 If there is a God as described by the Christians for instance then 
 He has existence apart from and independent of humankind His 
 existence is outside of our frame of reference reality 
 
Thus god does not really exist How true This claim would 
lend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually 
seamless virtual realities 
 
Does god exist or not To us this question is a true dichotomy 
 
Can god know a reason for her existence If she is omniscient then 
she must know this There is a philosophical problem whether anything 
can exist without a time frame  for instance if it were possible to 
observe our universe from outside in the neverness surrounding 
this universe it would never have existed  
 
Thus we are faced with a trilemma 
 
1 God metaexists and from this metaexisting perspective she 
created existence the Universe and everything  
 
This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing which 
is precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis Lizhi  Shuxian  
Creation of the Universe say This nothingness is not empty enough 
it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence 
until there is no when yet but never mind god the source of 
all existence started to play I fail to see the difference between 
these two forms of nothingness though If there isnt one it might 
be god is not necessary for creation 
 
It is obvious that the levels of metaexistence are not necessarily 
limited to god there might be a metagod on some other level 
 
2 God exists and has always existed she has a timescale which 
is different from our own This sounds sensible but it is difficult 
to conceive how she could know why she exists  a being which 
has always existed and is infinitely conscious of itself can 
remember that she has always been the same and perhaps know herself 
completely but she cannot know why she exists and how she knows 
everything she knows Would a knowledge of how a being with a  
personality a subjective viewpoint knows everything be this 
beings knowledge A conscious being conscious of everything is 
actually a contradiction in terms  it means that god is only 
conscious of herself since we and the whole universe are 
already incorporated in her mental models thoroughly modelled 
Actually a conscious being conscious of only itself is not 
conscious at all  
 
3 God is herself the Existence This is nothing more than an Orwellian 
redefinition of the word existence A logical consequence of this 
statement is that god is actually all existence
