Leonard Ill give you an example of this 
 
My father recently bought a business the business price was 150000 pounds 
and my father approached the people in the community for help he raised 
60000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and  
Muslims he knew 50000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan after 
paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans 
to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest this 
is an example of a Muslim community helping one another why did they help 
because of their common identity as Muslims In turn my father has helped 
with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay  
and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more 
fortunate in the community  
 
The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight 
iThat is the beauty of Islam
