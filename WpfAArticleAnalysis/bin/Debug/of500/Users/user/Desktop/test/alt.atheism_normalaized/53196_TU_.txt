THAT'S NOT TRUE.    I GAVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES.   ONE WAS THE RATHER
PEVASIVE ANTI-SEMITISM IN GERMAN CHRISTIANITY WELL BEFORE HITLER
ARRIVED.   THE OTHER WAS THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL RANKS THAT WERE USED
IN IMPERAIL GERMANY AND AUSTRIA TO DISTINGUISH JEWS FROM THE REST 
OF THE POPULATION.

NEITHER OF THESE WERE VERY TERRIBLE IN THEMSELVES, BUT BOTH HELPED
TO SET A PSYCHOLOGY IN WHICH THE GRADUAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF JEWS
WAS MADE EASIER.
