This isnt true  Many people are forced to use the automobile system 
I certainly dont use it by choice  If there were other ways of getting 
around Id do it

But I think that the Court system has been refinedover hundreds of 
years in the US Britain and other countries  We have tried to make 
it as fair as possible  Can it be made better without removing the 
death penalty  Besides life imprisonment sounds like a fatal punishment 
to me
