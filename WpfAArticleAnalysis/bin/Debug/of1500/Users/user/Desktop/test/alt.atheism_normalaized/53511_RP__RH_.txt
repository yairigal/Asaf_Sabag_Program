And what is better Better is a subjective value judgement 
 
I tell you a lie and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars 
of assets and move to India From my perspective falsehood was a  
substantially better than telling the truth How do you think a 
log of gurus make a living 
 
I attack your country in war kill everyone and take your rich 
natural resources Before I did this I was living in poverty 
Looks to me like war was much better than peace 
 
I see no need to go any further Once you address this little issue 
of betterness being nonrelativistic we can continue
