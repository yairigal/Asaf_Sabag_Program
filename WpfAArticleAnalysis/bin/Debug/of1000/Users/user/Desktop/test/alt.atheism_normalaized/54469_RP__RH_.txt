Frank you are attempting to inject goodness judgements where there 
are only accuracy judgements by essentially punning on the word 
value which has both meanings  
 
useful is a goodness judgement  Reasonable is an accuracy judgement  
They are not the same thing at all Useful in making some conclusion is  
an accuracy judgement again Im afraid  
 
This is the root of the problem I bloomin well amnt punning on the 
word value  I know its ambiguous  Ive told you the sense in 
which Im using it worth use goodness etc  And value DOESNT mean 
accuracy by any stretch of the imagination  Value=result of a computation 
is not what I mean but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of 
value  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field   
 
I can only understand that by useful in making some conclusion is an accuracy 
judgement you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making 
that conclusion or not   Thats part of what I mean by objective 
valuation  values grounded in solid facts  One doesnt value x for the  
purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesnt really do that The 
rest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values eg  our own  
freedom are solid facts in themselves 
 
Consider each of the following statements 
 
1 The only reason that the distinction between accurate and  
inaccurate exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful   
 
2 The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people 
finds the distinction between accurate and inaccurate useful in 
dealing with phenomena 
 
3 Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in 
modelling phenomena 
 
Where is the pun of which you speak  Where am I arguing from idiom   
And what is wrong if those statements are true with concluding that the  
basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena ie  
subjective values    After all what on earth is 3 if not a  
subjective value judgement  an accurate value judgement maybe 
 
Just to illustrate what I mean whats the difference between saying 
simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have 
to model phenomena and say Love and intelligence are the best tools we have 
to achieve freedom  Is one objective the other not  Both are  
judgements about value best and both have the same empirical basis from  
where I sit 
 
Sorry Frank but all youre doing is 
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue IF you 
mean to say that science is based on value accuracy judgements 
I have no problem with that If you mean to say that its based 
on value goodness judgements thats nonsense By contrast 
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements 
 
Im afraid I do mean to say that its based on goodness judgements 
Simple theories with accurate predictions are better better BETTER  
tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate  
predictions is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make  A  
relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of science  
or of a given scientist  but it seems pretty solid and objective to me
