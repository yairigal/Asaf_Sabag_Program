I'D SAY IT WAS MOTIVATED BY A PRIMITIVE NOTION OF REVENGE, AND BY
MISGUIDED PATRIOTISM.  OTHERWISE, I'D HAVE TO WONDER HOW COME MAINLAND
CATHOLICS ARE NOT KILLED BY MAINLAND PROTESTANTS, AND SOUTHERN
CATHOLICS ARE NOT KILLED BY SOUTHERN PROTESTANTS, AND SO ON.  TAKE AWAY
ALL PLAUSIBLE CAUSES BAR RELIGION, AND THE VIOLENCE DIMINISHES MARKEDLY.
GEE, WHY _IS_ THAT?

THE COUNTRY ALSO HAS A DIFFERENT OFFICIAL LANGUAGE WRITTEN IN ITS
CONSTITUTION (AND VICE VERSA :-) - MAYBE THEY'RE MOTIVATED BY A LOVE OF 
IRISH POETRY.  YOUR ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS, JON.

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I AGREE WITH ALL THAT YOU SAY ABOUT IRELAND ABOVE, 
AND MORE.
