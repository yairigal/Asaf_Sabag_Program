Now Ill raise the issue again in connection with Mr ODwyers use 
of the word plausible 
 
I can plause all kinds of cases for example in which people  
actually own land but dont know that and so are willing to sell  
it in play for derisory sums only to find that they sold it for 
real   Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired   Cases 
in which they err about the true value of what they are selling 
 
Pretty soon you have to start talking about informed owner 
competent owner educated owner and so on and the concept 
gets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible 
 
But the real problem remains that of looking only at endpoints 
in a context    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble  
is small and that the Moon is big but that does not mean that 
you have an objective measuring scale   Only that these two are  
fairly common opinions *in context* 
 
An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually tiny and 
a microbiologist may remark that a pebble is huge   Similarly 
if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his  
life for his land rather than killing him and taking it for free  
the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal
