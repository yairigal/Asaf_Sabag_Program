                          An Introduction to Atheism 
                       by mathew 
 
This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism  Whilst I 
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you 
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  I 
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some 
relevant books are listed in a companion article 
 
To provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this article 
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  All the 
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped 
up repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  Some other 
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article 
 
Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions 
posed from a Christian viewpoint  This is because the FAQ files reflect 
questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christians 
who proselytize on altatheism 
 
So when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such as 
Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine 
being  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it 
may not 
 
What is atheism 
 
Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God 
Some atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former is 
often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong 
atheism 
 
It is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weak 
atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strong 
atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do not 
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists 
 
Some atheists believe in the nonexistence of all Gods others limit their 
atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than making 
flatout denials 
 
But isnt disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesnt exist 
 
Definitely not  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe 
it to be true  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to 
believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or 
not  Which brings us to agnosticism 
 
What is agnosticism then 
 
The term agnosticism was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the 
Metaphysical Society in 1876  He defined an agnostic as someone who 
disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things 
must be some cause unknown and unknowable 
 
Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for 
sure whether God exists 
 
Words are slippery things and language is inexact  Beware of assuming that 
you can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the fact 
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  For example many people 
use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when 
referring to strong atheism 
 
Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it 
is very difficult to generalize about atheists  About all you can say for 
sure is that atheists dont believe in God  For example it certainly isnt 
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out 
about the universe 
 
So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism 
 
There are many philosophical justifications for atheism  To find out why a 
particular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask her 
 
Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions 
is essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible that 
such a God could exist  Others are atheists through scepticism because they 
see no evidence that God exists 
 
But isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of something 
 
There are many counterexamples to such a statement  For example it is 
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than 
all other prime numbers  Of course this deals with welldefined objects 
obeying welldefined rules  Whether Gods or universes are similarly 
welldefined is a matter for debate 
 
However assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably 
impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence of 
God  If we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to 
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexample 
 
If on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in 
question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid 
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing 
might be found to show that it isnt there  Such an exhaustive search is 
often impractical or impossible  There is no such problem with largest 
primes because we can prove that they dont exist 
 
Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things
