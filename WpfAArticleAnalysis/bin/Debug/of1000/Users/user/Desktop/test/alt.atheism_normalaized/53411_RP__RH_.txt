Not true Only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole 
will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon In the 
particles own reference frame it takes a very finite time to reach the 
horizon and the singularity The math does indeed predict this Take a look 
at Mitchner Thorne and Wheelers Gravitation

Dont forget to sing 
            They say theres a heaven for those who will wait 
                Some say its better but I say it aint 
        Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints 
                     The sinners are much more fun 
                         Only the good die young
