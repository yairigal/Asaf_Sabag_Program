I THINK THIS IS A BIG LEAP SEX->DEPRESSION.  ONE EXAMPLE IS MYSELF,
WHERE NO SEX->DEPRESSION :)  BUT, SERIOUSLY 1) PROMISCUITY IS ON A DECLINE,
DEPRESSION IS NOT AND 2) IT MIGHT BE MORE REASONABLE TO SAY 
DEPRESSION->PROMISCUITY.  I THINK DEPRESSION IS MORE LIKELY TO COME
FROM EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS (RELATIONSHIPS, FAMILY, JOB, FRIENDS) AND
PROMISCUITY IS USED AS AN ESCAPE.
SINCE I SEE MARRIAGE AS A CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS BOND RATHER THAN AN
EMOTIONAL BOND, I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH SEX BEFORE (NOT OUTSIDE OF)
MARRIAGE SO LONG AS YOU HAVE THE SAME COMMITMENT AND DEVOTION AS
WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM A MARRIED COUPLE.  OF COURSE, THIS IS JUST 
MY OPINION.
