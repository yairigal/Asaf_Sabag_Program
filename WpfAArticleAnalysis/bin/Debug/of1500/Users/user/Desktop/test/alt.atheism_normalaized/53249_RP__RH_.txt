If a person gives a wellbalanced reasoned argument Tammy then all are 
happy to discuss it with him  If he makes astounding claims which are not 
backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them 
If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not 
supportable then people would have simply ignored him  He did not  He 
claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed  His argument was for 
christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe 
him and his message  I for one will not take things as read  If you told me 
that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark 
side of Jupiter then I would demand evidence
