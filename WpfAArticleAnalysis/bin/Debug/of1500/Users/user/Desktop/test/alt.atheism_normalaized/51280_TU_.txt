 HOW ABOUT THIS DESCRIPTION: "AN OBJECT THAT IS, AT ONE TIME, BOTH A
EUCLIDEAN SQUARE AND A EUCLIDEAN CIRCLE"? I HOLD THAT NO OBJECT SATISFYING
THIS DESCRIPTION COULD EXIST. THE DESCRIPTION IS INCONSISTENT, AND HENCE
DESCRIBES AN OBJECT THAT COULD NOT EXIST.
 NOW, SUPPOSE SOMEONE POINTED TO A BICYCLE, AND SAID, "THAT OBJECT IS,
AT ONE TIME, BOTH A EUCLIDEAN SQUARE AND A EUCLIDEAN CIRCLE." THIS DOES
NOT MEAN THAT THE BICYCLE DOES NOT EXIST, IT MEASN THAT THE DESCRIPTION
WAS INCORRECTLY APPLIED.
 
 THE ATHEIST SAYS, "THE DESCRIPTIONS OF GOD THAT I HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH
ARE CONTRADICTORY, AND HENCE DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT CANNOT EXIST."
 NOW, YOUR POSITION (SO FAR AS I CAN GATHER) IS THAT GOD EXISTS, BUT THE
DESCRIPTIONS ATHEISTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH ARE SIMPLY BAD DESCRIPTIONS
OF IT.
 THIS IS ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN A BICYCLE, AND,
WHEN THEY ASK FOR A DESCRIPTION FROM PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN ONE,
ARE TOLD THAT IT IS A "EUCLIDEAN CIRCLE-SQUARE". CAN THEY BE BLAMED FOR
DOUBTING RATHER STRONGLY THAT THIS 'BICYCLE' EXISTS AT ALL?

>(I'M NOT AN OBJECTIVIST, REMEMBER.)

 NO KIDDING. :->

 SINCERELY,
