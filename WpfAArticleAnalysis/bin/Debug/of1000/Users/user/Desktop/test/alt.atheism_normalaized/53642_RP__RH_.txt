abstract argument   Northern Irish Protestants say

|> a mind   Maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks 
|> I certainly dont believe that the Unionists are in it for God  I think

Im still listening to what they say and you are still telling us  
your version of what they think   You read minds and I dont 
 
Youve speculated on my motives often enough and you dont take 
my statements of my own beliefs at face value  therefore your claim  
not to read minds has no credibility with me sorry   I also note that  
you fail to answer my question  It just looks to me very much like 
you have an axe to grind  especially as you are indeed ignoring what  
most Protestants say  which is stop the killing  The people you 
refer to are properly described as Unionists not Protestants 
 
As for their position of privilege what is that if not religion 
based 
 
It is based on politics bigotry and heartless extremism  None of these 
things are synonymous with religion though there is certainly some 
overlap
