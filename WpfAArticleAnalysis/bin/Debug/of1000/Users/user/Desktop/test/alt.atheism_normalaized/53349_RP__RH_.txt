Wow You got me thinking now 
 
This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  
move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal  
activities as OK  In the past it seems to me there were always two  
coexisting methods of social control 
 
First and most explicit is legal control  That is the set of  
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  
of punishments 
 
Secondly and somewhat more hidden is social control  These are  
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  
by legal control are scrictly controled by social censure Ideally if  
socialization is working as it should legal control is hardly ever needed  
since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  
social censure 
 
The control manifests itself in daytoday life as guilt and  
morality  Ive heard it said and fully believe that if it werent for  
the VAST majority of people policing themselves legal control would be  
absolutely impossible 
 
Lately last 50 100 years however there has been a move to  
attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ie if it aint  
illegal then dont pick on me  Im not saying this is wrong merely  
that it is a byproduct of a society which has 
 
	1 A high education level 
	2 A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media 
	3 A high level of institutionalized individual rights and 
	4 A me oriented culture 
 
I guess what Im saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition  
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can 
cant allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness yet we  
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  
those freedoms dont impinge on anothers 
 
IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here  While we  
appreciate and persue individual rights these satisfy the old  
territoriality and dominance instincts the removal of socialized  
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  
continued destabilization of society   
 
I got no quick fix  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  
mess  I know I would never consent to the rollback of personal freedoms  
in order to stabilize society  Yet I believe development of societies  
follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability  Can we find a  
social model which maximizes indiv freeds yet is stable  Perhaps it is  
possible to live with a nonstable society 
 
Anybody see a way out  Comments 
 
PS  Therefore answer to question 3  We dont  Do we want to
