#FRANK, RELATIVISM IS NOT KEEN TO MAKE SUCH JUDGEMENTS, UNLIKE
#OBJECTIVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE KEEN TO COMPARE THEIR TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD.
#THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY COMPETING OBJECTIVE MORAL 
#SYSTEMS SO YOU HAVE THIS HUGE SEMANTIC NET OF DELTA DIFFERENCES. 
#MAYBE I SHOULD NOT MENTION THE 'MAGICAL WORD' THAT DESCRIBES
#THIS SITUATION :-).

"RELATIVISM ISN'T KEEN"???    UP THERE SOMEONE SAYS THAT RELATIVISM
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL MORAL SYSTEMS ARE EQUAL.  SO, WHAT *DOES*
RELATIVISM MEAN?  NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY?  :-)

SPECIFICALLY, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT RELATIVISM CONCLUDES WHEN TWO
PEOPLE GROTESQUELY DISAGREE.  IS IT:

(A) BOTH ARE RIGHT

(B) ONE OF THEM IS WRONG, AND SOMETIMES (THOUGH PERHAPS RARELY) WE HAVE A 
    PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO IT IS

(C) ONE OF THEM IS WRONG, BUT WE NEVER HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHO, SO
    WE MAKE OUR BEST GUESS IF WE REALLY MUST MAKE A DECISION.

(D) THE IDEA OF A "RIGHT" MORAL JUDGEMENT IS MEANINGLESS (IMPLYING THAT
     WHETHER PEACE IS BETTER THAN WAR, E.G., IS A MEANINGLESS QUESTION,
     AND NEED NOT BE DISCUSSED FOR IT HAS NO CORRECT ANSWER)

(E) SOMETHING ELSE.  A SHORT, POSITIVE ASSERTION WOULD BE NICE.

AS I HOPE YOU CAN TELL, (B) AND (C) ARE ACTUALLY PREDICATED ON
THE ASSUMPTION THAT VALUES ARE REAL  - SO STATEMENTS LIKE THESE
_CAN'T_ CONSISTENTLY DERIVE FROM THE RELATIVIST ASSUMPTION THAT VALUES
AREN'T PART OF OBJECTIVE REALITY.
