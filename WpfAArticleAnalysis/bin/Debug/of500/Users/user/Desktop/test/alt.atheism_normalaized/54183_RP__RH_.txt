Perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is  If we 
cant measure anything objectively then the answers we get from physics 
arent objective either  Thats what I mean when I say theres no objective 
physics 
 
Sure we can all agree that say F = GMmr2 but thats maths  Its only 
physics when you relate it to the real world and if we cant do that 
objectively were stuck  Of course this displays my blatant bias towards 
applied science but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real 
world situations based on real world observations

Its an axiom that its invariant  But if the two of us measure it well 
get different answers  Yes we call that experimental error but its not 
really error in the conventional sense in fact if you dont get any 
thats an error  
 
You could argue that the value of c is objective to within + <some 
value>  But Id call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and 
it opens the way for statements like Murder is objectively wrong for all 
people to within 1 of the total population
