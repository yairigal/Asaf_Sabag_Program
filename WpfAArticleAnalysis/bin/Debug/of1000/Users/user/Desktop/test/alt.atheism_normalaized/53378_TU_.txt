SUPPOSE X-IST SAUCERS LAND.  THE ALIENS DESTROY ALL PAPER CURRENCY AND TATTOO
"666" ON PEOPLE'S FOREHEADS AND START SACRIFICING SMALL CHILDREN.  THEN A
BUNCH OF OTHER ALIENS COME ALONG AND OFFER TO GET RID OF THE X-ISTS IN RETURN
FOR ONE DOLLAR.  THE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO HAVE A SINGLE DOLLAR BILL HIDDEN DURING
THE PURGE.

GET THE POINT?  NONE OF THESE EVENTS ARE *INHERENTLY* IMPOSSIBLE.  SO IT IS
NOT THE CASE THAT THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR BILL IS FIXED BY REALITY.

FOR A MORE MUNDANE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR BILL IS NOT CONSTANT,
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING GAME THOUGHT UP BY THE RAND CORPORATION:

YOU ARE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS.  YOU HAVE A $10 BILL.  YOU OFFER TO SELL THE
$10 BILL TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER -- SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTION THAT YOU ALSO
GET TO TAKE THE MONEY BID BY THE SECOND-HIGHEST BIDDER.

TRY IT.  YOU'LL FIND THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL END UP BIDDING MORE THAN $10
FOR YOUR $10 BILL.
