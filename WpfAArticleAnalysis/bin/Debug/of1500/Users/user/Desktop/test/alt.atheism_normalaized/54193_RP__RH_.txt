First you seem to assume all atheists think alike  An atheist does not 
believe in the existence of a god  Our opinions on issues such as  
capital punishment and abortion however vary greatly   
 
If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist Benedikt I  
presume then please present your argument as such and do not lump us 
all together 
 
As for the issues lets start with abortion  Personally I do not support 
abortion as a means of population control or contraceptionafterthefact 
However I support the right of any woman to have an abortion regardless 
of what my personal views may be because it would be arrogant of me to tell 
any individual what heshe may or may not do to hisher body and the domain 
of legislators should not extend into the uterus  Thats my opinion and I 
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me 
 
I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control but I  
certainly defend it as an end to itself  I think most homosexuals would 
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as 
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down   
 
As for atheists believing all values are biological I have no idea what 
youre talking about 
 
Finally there are the issues of war and capital punishment  An atheist 
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might  You seem to 
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  
population control  Could this be the atheist cause you were referring  
to a few posts back
