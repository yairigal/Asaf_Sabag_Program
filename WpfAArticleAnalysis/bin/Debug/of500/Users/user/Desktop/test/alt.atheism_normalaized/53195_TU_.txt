THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I EVER HEARD.   ARE YOU SERIOUS?

	"IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO BE MORAL?"

|> ALSO, I'VE SAID THAT MORALITY IS A REMNANT OF EVOLUTION.  

REALLY?   AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DISCUSS MORALITY ON A DAILY BASIS?
BECAUSE IT'S A KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY HANGOVER, LIKE YOUR LITTLE TOE?

THIS MUST BE SOME NOVEL USE OF THE PHRASE "BASED ON" WITH WHICH I
AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR.    WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "BASED ON" AND 
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT FOR YOUR ARGUMENT?

WELL, WE CAN.   WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT MY PARTICULAR MORAL
BELIEFS?

IF YOU RAISE A TOPIC I'VE NEVER CONSIDERED, I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY TO 
INVENT A MORAL BELIEF OUT OF THIN AIR.
