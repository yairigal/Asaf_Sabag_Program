>>>HOW DO YOU RATE PUBLIC FLOGGINGS OR FLOGGINGS AT ALL? CHOPPING OFF THE

>>I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FLOGGINGS, PARTICULARLY, WHEN THE OFFENDERS
>>HAVE BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR BEFORE FLOGGINGS ARE
>>GIVEN. I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MAIMING IN GENERAL, BY WHATEVER MEANS.
>>IN MY OPINION NO-ONE WHO HAS NOT MAIMED ANOTHER SHOULD BE MAIMED. IN

>MAY I ASK IF YOU HAD THE SAME OPINION BEFORE YOU BECAME A MUSLIM?



SURE. YES, I DID. YOU SEE I DON'T THINK THAT RAPE AND MURDER SHOULD
BE DEALT WITH LIGHTLY. YOU, BEING SO INTERESTED IN LENIENCY FOR
LENIENCY'S SAKE, APPARENTLY THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SIMPLY BE
TOLD THE "DID A _BAD_ THING."


>AND WHAT ABOUT THE SIMPLE CHANCE OF MISJUDGEMENTS?

MISJUDGMENTS SHOULD BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
I SUSPECT THAT IT'S PRETTY UNLIKELY THAT, GIVEN MY REQUIREMENT
OF REPEATED OFFENSES, THAT MISJUDGMENTS ARE VERY LIKELY.

 
>>>>>>"ORIENT" IS NOT A PLACE HAVING A SINGLE CHARACTER. YOUR IGNORANCE

>>>>>READ CAREFULLY, I HAVE NOT SAID ALL THE ORIENT SHOWS PRIMITIVE MACHISM.


>>>>WELL THEN, WHY NOT USE MORE SPECIFIC WORDS THAN "ORIENT"? PROBABLY
>>>>BECAUSE IN YOUR MIND THERE IS NO NEED TO (IT'S ALL THE SAME).


>>>BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. WHILE MORE DETAIL IS POSSIBLE,
>>>IT IS NOT NECESSARY.


>>AND EUROPE SHOWS CIVILIZED BULLSHIT. THIS IS BULLSHIT. TIME TO PUT OUT

>>GUILTY OF STUPIDITIES.


>I JUST LOVE TO COMPARE SUCH LINES TO THE COMMON PLEA OF YOUR FELLOW BELIEVERS
>NOT TO CALL EACH OTHERS NAMES. IN THIS CASE, TO SUBSTANTIATE IT: THE QURAN
>ALLOWS THAT ONE BEATS ONE'S WIFE INTO SUBMISSION. 


REALLY? CARE TO GIVE CHAPTER AND VERSE? WE COULD DISCUSS IT.


>PRIMITIVE MACHISM REFERS TO
>THAT. (I HAVE MISSPELT THAT BEFORE, MY FAULT).
 

AGAIN, NOT ALL OF THE ORIENT FOLLOWS THE QUR'AN. SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.


SORRY, YOU HAVEN'T "PUT OUT" ENOUGH.

 
>>>ISLAM EXPRESSES EXTRAMARITAL SEX. EXTRAMARITAL SEX IS A SUBSET OF SEX. IT IS
>>>SUPPRESSEDIN ISLAM. THAT MARIAL SEXIS  ALLOWED OR ENCOURAGED IN ISLAM, AS
>>>IT IS IN MANY BRANCHES OF CHRISTIANITY, TOO, MISSES THE POINT.

>>>READ THE PART ABOUT THE URGE FOR SEX AGAIN. RELIGIONS THAT RUN AROUND TELLING
>>>PEOPLE HOW TO HAVE SEX ARE NOT MY PIECE OF CAKE FOR TWO REASONS: SUPPRESSING
>>>A STRONG URGE NEEDS  STRONG MEASURES, AND IT IS NOT THEIR BUSINESS ANYWAY.

>>BELIEVE WHAT YOU WISH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT.
>>ALL I AM READING ARE OPINIONS.
 
>IT IS AN ARGUMENT. THAT YOU DOUBT THE VALIDITY OF THE PREMISES DOES NOT CHANGE
