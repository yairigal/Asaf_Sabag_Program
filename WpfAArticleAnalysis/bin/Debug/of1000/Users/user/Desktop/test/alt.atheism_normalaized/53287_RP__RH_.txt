Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals  Where do they come  
from  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from 
whatever is societally mandated 
 
Its only one aspect of morality  Societal morality is necessarily 
very crude and broadbrush stuff which attempts to deal with what 
is necessary to keep that society going   and often its a little 
overenthusiastic about doing so  Individual morality is a different 
thing it often includes societal mores or society is in trouble 
but is stronger  For example some people are vegetarian though eating 
meat may be perfectly legal

Doesnt help  Is the point irrelevant 
 
No  Often the answer is we are  But if society is those who make 
the rules thats a different question  If society is who should 
make the rules thats yet another  I dont claim to have the answers either 
but I dont think we do it very well in Ireland and I like some things 
about the US system at least in principle

>Depends 
On  Again this comes from a certain question see above 
 
Well ideally they dont but if they must they should do it by consensus IMO

So how can we put people in jail How can we condemn other societies 
 
Because sometimes thats necessary  The hard trick is to recognise when 
it is and equally importantly when it isnt 
 
 and only interfering when its truly 
>necessary 
 
Why would it be necessary  What right do we have to interfere 
 
IMO it isnt often that interference ie jail and force of various 
kinds and degrees is both necessary and effective  Where you derive  
the right to interfere is a difficult question  its a sort of 
liars paradox force is necessary for freedom   One possible justification 
is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldnt object if 
their own freedom is taken away  the paradox doesnt arise if 
we dont actively wish to take way anyones freedom 
 
  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem 
>that it can be either too much or too little  but most people seem 
>to agree that some level of interference is necessary 
 
They see the need for a justice system  How can we even define that term 
 
Only by consensus I guess 
 
  Thus you 
>get a situation where The law often allows what honour forbids which Ive 
>come to believe is as it should be   
 
I admit I dont understand that statement 
 
What I mean is that while thusandsuch may be legal thusandsuch may 
also be seen as immoral   The law lets you do it but you dont let yourself 
do it  Eating meat for example
