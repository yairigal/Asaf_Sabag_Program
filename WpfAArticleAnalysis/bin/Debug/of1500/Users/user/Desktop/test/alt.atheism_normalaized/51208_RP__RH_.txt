 Heres the main problem The scenario you outline is reasonably  
consistent but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does 
not support it but indicates something far different The Earth by 
latest estimates is about 46 billion years old and has had life for 
about 35 billion of those years Humans have only been around for at 
most about 200000 years But the fossil evidence inidcates that life 
has been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long before 
there were people Yes there are fossils that show signs of disease 
mostly bone disorders of course but there are some Heck not just 
fossil evidence but what weve been able to glean from genetic study shows 
that disease has been around for a long long time If human sin was what 
brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then 
how could it exist before humans

 Uh I know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about 
biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this There 
is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off 
in perfect condition It seems to adapt to its envionment in a 
collective sense Im really curious as to what you mean by the 
degeneration of the genetic code

 Umm Nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and 
bacteria and they to us Only a very small percentage of microlife is 
harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby 
constant in size but the ranks keep changing For example bubonic 
plague used to be a really nasty disease Im sure youll agree But 
it still pops up from time to time even today and doesnt do as 
much damage Part of that is because of better sanitation but even 
when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in 
the past This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible 
died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed 
forgive the poor terminology Im an engineer not a doctor >  and 
died off for lack of nearby hosts 
 I could be wrong on this but from what I gather acne is only a few 
hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer It seems to 
be getting less nasty wage

 Now wait a minute I have a question Humans were created perfect right 
And you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease It 
seems unlikely that Satan whos making the diseases would also gift 
humans with the means to fight them off Simpler to make the diseases less 
lethal if he wants survivors As far as I can see our immune systems 
imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us 
by God I want to be clear on this are you saying that God was planning 
ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune 
system that was not at the time of design necessary That is God made 
our immune systems ahead of time knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and 
their descendents would need to fight off diseases

 Heres another puzzle What exactly do you mean by perfect in the 
phrase created perfect and without flaw To my mind a perfect 
system would be incapable of degrading over time A perfect system 
that will without constant intervention become imperfect is *not* a 
perfect system At least IMHO 
 Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a 
bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmers glue That is the 
original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in 
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart 
If so why could God not have used better materials 
 Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself 
of did It just choose not to

>In summary newborns are innocent but God does not cause their suffering 
 
 My main point as I said was that there really isnt any evidence for 
the explanation you give At least that Im aware of But I couldnt 
help making a few nitpicks here and there >
