Not really Most of the prophesies arent even prophesies Theyre prayers 
and comments taken from the Torah quite out of context Seems Xians started 
lying right from the beginning

Im still willing to die for what I believe and dont believe So were the 
loonies in Waco So what  
 
Besides the points not to die for what one believes in The points to 
make that other sorry sonofabitch to die for what *he* believes in

Peter the Damed and damned proud of it

            They say theres a heaven for those who will wait 
                Some say its better but I say it aint 
        Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints 
                     The sinners are much more fun 
                         Only the good die young
