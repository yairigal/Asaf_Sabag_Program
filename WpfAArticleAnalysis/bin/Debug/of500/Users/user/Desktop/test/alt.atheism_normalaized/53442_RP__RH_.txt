This is fascinating Atheists argue for abortion defend homosexuality 
as a means of population control insist that the only values are 
biological and condemn war and capital punishment According to 
Benedikt if something is contardictory it cannot exist which in 
this case means atheists I suppose 
I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an 
excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital 
punishment Im sorry but the logic escapes me 
And why just capital punishment what is being questioned here the 
propriety of killing or of punishment What is the basis of the 
ecomplaint
