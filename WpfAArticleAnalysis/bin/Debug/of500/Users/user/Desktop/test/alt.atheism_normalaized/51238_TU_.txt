BUT YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT OF PROPOGANDA.  REMEMBER, IF YOU
ASKED GERMANS BEFORE WWII IF THE JEWS SHOUDL BE SLAUGHTERED, THEY WOULD
PROBABLY ANSWER NO, BUT, AFTER THE PROPOGANDA MACHINE ROLLED THROUGH, AT
LEAST SOME WERE ABLE TO TOLERATE IT.

YOU SEE, IT ONLY TAKES A SMALL GROUP OF FANATICS TO WHIP UP A GENERAL
FRENZY.

>>THE PROPOGANDA MACHINES HAVE BEEN IN GEAR OVER A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING
>>ABORTION AND GAYS...  LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED.
>WELL, SO FAR THEY HAVE PASSED ONE AMENDMENT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER
>INTENSE SCRUTINY, AND THEY HAVE FAILED TO OUTLAW ABORTION, WHICH IS THEIR
>PRIME GOAL ON THAT ISSUE. YEP, THEY SEEM SOOO EFFECTIVE. SURE.

WELL, THEY HAVEN'T MANAGED TO OUTLAW ABORTION DUE TO THE POSSIBLE OBJECTIVITY
OF THE COURTS.  BUT, THEY HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE QUITE A FEW PROBLEMS FOR
PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO HAVE AN ABORTION.  THEY COULD CREATE SIMILAR PROBLEMS
FOR US.  AND, IT COULD BE WORSE.  THEY CAN TRY TO STOP ABORTIONS BY BLOCKING
CLINICS, ETC., BUT IMAGINE WHAT THEY'D HAVE TO DO TO STOP ATHEISM.

>>>>BESIDES, THE MARGIN OF ERROR IS VERY LARGE WHEN YOU ONLY TALK TO TWO PEOPLE.
>>>BETTER THAN YOUR ONE, THAT IS, YOUR OPINION. ALSO, I HAVE BRANCHED
>>>OUT AND THE INFORMAL SURVEY IS UP OVER HALF A DOZEN NOW.
>>AND, WHAT HAVE THEY SAID?  WERE YOU QUESTIONS UNBIASED?
>KEITH, YOU WOULD CLAIM THAT MY QUESTIONS ARE BIASED THE MINUTE I POSTED
>THEM, BECAUSE THE ANSWERS AGREED WITH ME. EVERYONE I HAVE ASKED ABOUT
>THE POSSIBLE REMOVAL OF THE MOTTO (THE CHRISTIAN PORTION) HAS EXPRESSED
>REGRET ABOUT ITS LOSS, BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT. HOWEVER, WHEN IT IS POINTED
>OUT TO THEM THAT A NEW MOTTO WILL NOT BE IN THE WORKS, NONE HAVE EXPRESSED
>THE DESIRE TO RAPE, MURDER, PILLAGE, ETC., WHICH YOU HAVE BASICALLY CLAIMED.

SO, YOU ARE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM INDIVIDUALLY, BUT COULD YOU CONVINCE A
WHOLE ROOM OF THEM?  A WHOLE NATION?

>AS FOR THE ATHEIST PORTION (I KNOW SOME AROUND HERE), THEY HAVE ALL

>WHO USED THE MOTTO TO TRY TO SEEM JUSTIFIED. AND ALL WOULD SEE IT GONE.

YES, I'D BE GLAD
