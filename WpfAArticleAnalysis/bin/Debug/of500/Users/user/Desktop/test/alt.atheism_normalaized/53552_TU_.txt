MARK MCCULLOUGH (MCCULLOU@SNAKE2.CS.WISC.EDU) WROTE:
: THIS FIGURE, IS FAR BELOW ALL THE OTHER FIGURES I HAVE SEEN.  IF IT
: IS INDEED ACCURATE, THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN
: THAT FIGURE, AND OTHER FIGURES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS?
: MOST FIGURES I HAVE SEEN PLACE THE HIT RATIO CLOSE TO 70%, WHICH IS 
: STILL FAR HIGHER THAN YOUR 35%.  OR DOES YOUR FIGURE SAY A BOMB
: MISSED IF THE PLANE TOOK OFF WITH IT, AND THE BOMB NEVER HIT THE TARGET,
: REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE BOMB WAS DROPPED?  SUCH METHODS
: ARE USED ALL THE TIME TO LIE WITH STATISTICS.

ANSWERING THE LAST SENTENCE, CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD A SUCCESS RATE OF 80%
WITHOUT INITIALLY EXPLAINING, UNTIL PRESSED, THAT THIS MEANT THAT 80%
OF THE AIRCRAFT CAME BACK HAVING DROPPED THEIR BOMBS SOMEWHERE, REGARDLESS'
OF WHETHER THEY HAD HIT THE INTENDED TARGET, OR INDEED ANYTHING AL ALL.
