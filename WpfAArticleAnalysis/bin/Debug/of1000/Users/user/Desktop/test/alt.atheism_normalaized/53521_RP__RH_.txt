I assume you are posting to encourage comments  how much history has 
Tony Campello read  Not much it seems

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about 
If only those christian scientists would take note 
 
In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian  
scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly 
true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified 
by using the laws of physics  For example there are a few chaps who are  
trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old and that the 
error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  
light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been  
accounted for

Or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never  
intended to become a manifesto for a billion people  Did Tony follow that one 
up

Millions of people have died for a lie  This  point is difficult to  
substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments 
work in that way but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  
themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory 
of the Spanish invaders  The list is endless  The Aztecs lost BTW 
 
>Call me a fool but I believe he did heal people 
   
That is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone 
to become a christian  More to the point it does not add weight to 
the claim that Jesus was the real thing

Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany  More to the 
point did Tony mention this  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his 
many colleagues  fools or  illogical men their support of Hitler was based  
I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  
his principles  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler 
was sane

Hmmm I dont think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore

This is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions I have had with 
people result in  quoting the bible  The only reasonable way I think 
people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of 
metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to 
present  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or 
she will end up in all sorts of shit    
 
Tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe 
the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone  
who thinks the bible is total fiction that Jesus is real by quoting the 
book is totally pointless  For example in mathematics you cannot say a is 
equal to b because a is equal to b 
 
   
 
>	I dont think most people understand what a Christian is   
 
That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  
in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all 
claiming to be correct
