Has been discussed here Chapter and verse were cited I assume that you 
werent looking then 
  
Lets be more exact do you think it is not in the Quran And what would 
your consequences be when it it was shown to be in it

I have not claimed that It is sufficient for the argument when there are 
a lot of male dominated societies that qualify as Machistic Are you going 
to say that the situation of women is better in sufficeint areas of the 
Orient

You apparently have trouble reading things you dont like The point was 
having sex the way one wishes being a strong desire Marriage is a red 
herring Tell me about homosexuals for one You simply ignore everything 
that doesnt fit into the world as you would like to have it 
  
And as for the situation of adolescents one has probably keep your 
combination of leniency and maiming in mind whe you say that it does 
not take *overly* strong measures to suppress the urge for sex in 
adolescents
