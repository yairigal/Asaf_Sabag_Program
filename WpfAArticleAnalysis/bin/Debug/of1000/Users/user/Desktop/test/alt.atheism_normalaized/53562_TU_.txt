SIMPLE.  TAKE OUT SOME PHYSICS BOOKS, AND START LOOKING FOR STATEMENTS WHICH
SAY THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE PHYSICS.  I DOUBT YOU WILL FIND ANY.  YOU MIGHT
FIND STATEMENTS THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE LENGTH, OR NO OBJECTIVE LOCATION,

VACUUM IS INVARIANT.  THIS SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE AN OBJECTIVE
SPEED-OF-LIGHT-IN-VACUUM.)
