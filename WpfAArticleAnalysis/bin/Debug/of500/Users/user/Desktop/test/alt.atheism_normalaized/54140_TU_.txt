(E). (D) IS CLOSE BUT MISSES THE POINT THAT THERE IS A THIRD PARTY,
WITH THEIR OWN SUBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT, ASKED TO MAKE A DECISION.  PEACE
IS NOT "BETTER" THAN WAR, UNLESS WE VIEW THE SITUATION SUBJECTIVELY AS
HUMANS.  OF COURSE, WE *ARE* HUMANS, AND SO *DO* VIEW SITUATIONS FROM
OUR OWN PERSPECTIVE, SO IT IS MEANINGFUL FOR US TO DISCUSS QUESTIONS
OF WAR AND PEACE.
