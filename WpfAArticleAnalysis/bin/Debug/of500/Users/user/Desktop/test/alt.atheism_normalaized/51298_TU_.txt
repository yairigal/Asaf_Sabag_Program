ACTUALLY, THE STORY GOES THAT LUCIFER REFUSED TO BOW BEFORE MAN AS 
GOD COMMANDED HIM TO.  LUCIFER WAS DEVOTED TO GOD.

OH YEAH, THERE IS NOTHING IN GENESIS THAT SAYS THE SNAKE WAS ANYTHING
MORE THAN A SNAKE (WELL, A TALKING ONE...HAD LEGS AT THE TIME, TOO).

I DON'T THINK POINTING OUT CONTRADICTIONS IN STORIES IS THE BEST WAY
TO SHOW THE ERROR IN THEOLOGY:  IF THEY THINK A SUPERNATURAL ENTITY
KICKED THE FIRST HUMANS OUT OF PARADISE BECAUSE THEY BIT INTO A
FRUIT THAT GAVE THEM SPECIAL POWERS...WELL, THEY MIGHT NOT RESPOND
WELL TO REASON AND LOGIC.  :^)
