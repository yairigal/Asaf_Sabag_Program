  If Im wrong god is free at any time to correct my mistake  That 
  he continues not to do so while supposedly proclaiming his 
  undying love for my eternal soul speaks volumes 
 
  As for the trap you are not in a position to tell me that I dont

  motivations better than I do myself you should believe me when I 
  say that I earnestly searched for god for years and never found 
  him
