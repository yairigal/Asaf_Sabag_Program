This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense 
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which 
accepts 16 bytes and uses the first 8 to ECB the second 8 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input 
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics
