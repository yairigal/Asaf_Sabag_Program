FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT YOUR BUDDY!  SECOND, READ WHAT I WROTE.  I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT WHAT MUSLIMS ARE ALLOWED TO DO, MERELY WHAT *SOME*
PRACTICE.  THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MUSLIM AS YOU, SO DON'T RETORT
WITH THE OLD AND TIRED "THEY MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS" BULLSHIT.  IF I
GAVE YOU THE NAMES WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THIS INFORMATION?  IS A FATWA
GOING TO BE LEASHED OUT AGAINST THE PERPETRATORS?  DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT SOMEONE WHO DID IT WOULD VOLUNTARILY COME FORWARD AND CONFESS? 
WITH THE KIND OF EXTREMISM SHOWN BY YOUR CO-RELIGIONARIES?  FAT CHANCE.

AT ANY RATE, THERE CAN BE NO CONCLUSIVE "PROOF" BY THE VERY NATURE OF
THE ACT.  PERHAPS PEOPLE THAT INDULGE IN THIS PRACTICE AGREE WITH YOU IN
THEORY, BUT HOPE THAT ALLAH WILL FORGIVE THEM IN THE END.

I THINK IT'S RATHER ARROGANT OF YOU TO PRETEND TO SPEAK FOR ALL MUSLIMS
IN THIS REGARD.  ALSO, KIND OF SILLY.  ARE YOU INSINUATING THAT BECAUSE
THE KORANIC LAW FORBIDS IT, THERE ARE NO CRIMINALS IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES? 

THIS IS AS FAR AS I CARE TO GO ON THIS SUBJECT.  THE WEAKNESS OF YOUR
ARGUMENTS ARE FOR ALL NETTERS TO SEE.  OVER AND OUT...
