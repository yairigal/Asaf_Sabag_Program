Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media the Muslim voice on 
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes 
showing 
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations For every twenty or so 
newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting Rushdie there 
would 
appear one Muslim voice This person was usually selected based on how 
dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of Islam or the 
situation at the time This approx twenty to one ratio continued 
throughout the escalation of the crisis with Rushdie in the central 
spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everymans 
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility As an aside its 
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up 
some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued 
to be banned here It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these 
 
groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  
hate towards these groups For Muslims this kind of double standard  
was annoying 
 
Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at 
organized 
Islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill The only kind of Islam 
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular Islam  an Islam 
separated from its Quran its Prophet God its legislation and most 
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena Fine  Rushdie 
made 
his views known  the Muslims made
