ON A SIMILAR NOTE, A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WORKED AS A CLERK IN A
CHAIN BOOKSTORE.  SEVERAL OF HIS PEERS WERE AMAZING, ONE WOMAN IN
PARTICULAR:

A CUSTOMER ASKED HER IF THEY HAD _THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN_.  "WHO'S IT BY?" WAS HER FIRST QUESTION.  THEN, "IS HE
STILL ALIVE?"  THEN, "IS IT FICTION OR NON-FICTION?" 

FINALLY MY FRIEND INTERVENED, AND SHOWED THE GUY WHERE IT WAS.
 
IT MAKES ONE WONDER WHAT THE STANDARDS OF EMPLOYMENT ARE.
