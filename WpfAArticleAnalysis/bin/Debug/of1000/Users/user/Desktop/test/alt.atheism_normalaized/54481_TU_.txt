SORRY, GREGG, IT WAS NO ANSWER TO A POST OF MINE. AND YOU ARE QUITE
FOND OF USING ABUSING LANGUAGE WHENEVER YOU THINK YOUR RELIGION IS
MISREPRESENTED. BY THE WAY, I HAVE NO TROUBLE TELLING ME APART FROM
BOB BEAUCHAINE.
 
 
I STILL WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER TO THAT THE QURAN ALLOWS YOU TO BEAT YOUR WIFE
INTO SUBMISSION. YOU WERE QUITE UPSET ABOUT THE CLAIM THAT IT WAS IN IT,
TO BE MORE CORRECT, YOU SAID IT WASN'T.
 
I ASKED YOU ABOUT WHAT YOUR CONSEQUENCES WERE IN CASE IT WOULD BE IN THE
QURAN, BUT YOU HAVE SIMPLY CEASED TO RESPOND ON THAT THREAD. CAN IT BE
THAT YOU HAVE FOUND OUT IN THE MEANTIME THAT IT IS THE HOLY BOOK?
 
WHAT ARE YOUR CONSEQUENCES NOW? WAS YOUR BEING UPSET JUST A SHOW? DO YOU
SIMPLE INHERIT YOUR MORALS FROM A BOOK, IE IS IT SUDDENLY OK NOW? IS IT
CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE WORDS OF MUHAMMAD REFLECT THE PRIMITIVE MACHISM
OF HIS SOCIETY? OR HAVE YOU SPENT YOUR TIME WITH YOUR NEW GAINED FREEDOM?
