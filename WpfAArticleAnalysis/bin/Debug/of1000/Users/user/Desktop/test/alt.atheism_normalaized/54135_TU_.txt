ACTUALLY, I FIND THE STUFF ABOUT JC BEING A CARPENTER MORE
INTERESTING.  IS THERE AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE FOR THIS ASSERTION,
OR IS IT ALL FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE?  IS THERE ANY RECORD AT
ALL OF ANYTHING HE BUILT?  A TABLE, A HOUSE, SOME STAIRS (NORM
ABRAMS SAYS THE REAL TEST OF A CARPENTER'S SKILL IS BUILDING
STAIRS WITH HAND TOOLS).  DID HE LEAVE ANY PLANS BEHIND FOR, SAY
KITCHEN COUNTERS AND CABINETS?  DID HE BUILD HIS OWN CROSS?
IF SO, DID HE USE PRESSURE-TREATED LUMBER?  GOTTA USE THAT
PRESSURE-TREATED ANYWHERE THAT WOOD MEETS CONCRETE, BUT IT
HOLDS UP BETTER ANYWAY FOR MOSE OUTDOOR APPLICATIONS.  I KEEP
SEEING THESE BUMPER-STICKERS THAT SAY "MY BOSS IS A JEWISH
CARPENTER," BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS ON THE BACK OF FORD ESCORTS,
AND A REAL CARPENTER'S APPRENTICE WOULD PROBABLY DRIVE A
PICKUP, SO I'M OUT FOR VERIFICATION THAT HE REALLY WAS A
CARPENTER.
