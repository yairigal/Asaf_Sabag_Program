#> |PERHAPS YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT YOU THINK "SCIENCE HAS IT'S BASIS
#> |IN VALUES" MEANS. THE REASON WHY PEOPLE DO SCIENCE IS THAT
#> |THEY VALUE IT'S RESULTS. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SCIENCE HAS
#> |IT'S BASIS IN VALUES. ANY MORE THAN DES STOPS WORKING IF I STOP
#> |VALUING MY PRIVACY.
#> 
#> IT'S PARTLY AS YOU SAY: THE REASON WHY PEOPLE DO SCIENCE IS THAT THEY VALUE IT'S
#> RESULTS.  IF ONE FOLLOWS RELATIVISM TO THE LETTER, THEN, THE THEORIES
#> AND PREDICTIONS WHICH ARE THE RESULTS OF SCIENCE CAN ONLY BE SUBJECTIVELY
#> VALUED AS 'OBJECTIVE', 'CORRECT', OR ANYTHING ELSE.  ONE CANNOT ATTACH
#> ANY OBJECTIVE WORTH TO THE RESULTS OF SCIENCE,  FOR THE SIMPLE REASON
#> THAT ONE CANNOT ATTACH OBJECTIVE WORTH TO ANYTHING.
#
#SO WHAT? THE VALUE I ASSIGN THE RESULTS IS AS REAL *TO ME* AS THEY CAN GET.
#I'M JUST NOT LIMITED TO HOW THINGS ARE VALUABLE TO ME. ASIDE FROM OUR OWN
#DESIRES FOR ITS RESULTS, SCIENCE HAS NO VALUE. NEVERTHELESS, IT STILL
#ACCURATELY DESCRIBES HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS, HUMANS OR NO HUMANS.  

YOU WERE DOING FINE UNTIL THAT LAST SENTENCE.  I BELIEVE THIS TOO,
BUT PLEASE PROVE IT.

#>  WHICH FACTS TO OBSERVE?
#
#THAT'S THE VALUE JUDGEMENT YOU'RE CONFUSING, AND A QUESTION FOR AN
#INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHER. FOR SCIENCE, THE ANSWER IS UNEQUVOCAL: ALL.

IMPOSSIBLE. ONE OBSERVES THE SIMPLE FACTS, THE ONES THAT ARE LIKELY TO
TURN UP AGAIN.  JUDGEMENT CALL.  YOU CAN'T OBSERVE EVERYTHING, AND YOU
CAN'T TEST EVERY HYPOTHESIS.  THEREFORE YOU SELECT.  THAT'S A BUNCH
OF SUBJECTIVE PEOPLE JUDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF OBS. AND HYPOTHESES -
CAN THEY DO THIS RELIABLY?  

#>  WHAT IS A FACT?  WHEN AM I JUSTIFIED IN VALUING SENSORY INPUT AS SIGNAL RATHER THAN NOISE?  HOW DO I KNOW THAT EVERYONE MAKES THE CALL THE SAME AS I DO?
#
#YOU DON'T. THAT'S WHY IT TAKES SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN ONE OBSERVATION
#BEFORE A NEWLY OBSERVED PHENOMENON IS JUDGED TO BE REAL OR NOISE. I SUPPOSE
#YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE OUT THERE MAKING OBSERVATIONS
#TO FURTHER VERIFY F=MA. 

"JUDGED" TO BE REAL OR NOISE?  HOW DO I DO THIS?  DO YOU DO IT THE SAME
WAY AS I DO?  HOW DO WE KNOW THIS?  ARE WE ASSUMING AN OBJECTIVE REALITY
OR SOMETHING?  GEE, MAYBE WE ARE, AND JUDGEMENT IS NECESSARY TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

#> SO THE RELATIVIST ATTENDS TO A SYSTEM, DESIGNED AT WHIM, FED WITH WHAT SHOULD 
#> BE ASSUMED TO BE CONFLICTING DATA, IN THE EXPECTATION OF RESULTS WHICH NEED 
#> SATISFY NO-ONE.  GIGO.
#
#STRAWMAN. YOU'RE MIXING RELATIVISM IN VALUE FOR RELATIVISM IN OBSERVATION.

RELATIVISM IN VALUE => IF WE ALL PICK DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS TO STUDY, IT
