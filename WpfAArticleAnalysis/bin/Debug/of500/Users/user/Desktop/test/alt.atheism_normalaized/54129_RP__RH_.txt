  Speaking of proofs of God the funniest one I have ever seen was in a 
  term paper handed in by a freshman  She wrote God must exist because 
  he wouldnt be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really 
  doesnt  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological 
  proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes among 
  others
