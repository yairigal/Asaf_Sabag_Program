NOT ANY MORE SO THAN

      HOLDING PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL IS WRONG
      IF YOU HOLD PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL WE WILL PUNISH YOU
      OUR PUNISHMENT WILL BE TO HOLD YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL

IS THERE ANY PUNISHMENT WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING WHICH, IF DONE BY A PRIVATE
PERSON TO ANOTHER PRIVATE PERSON FOR NO APPARENT REASON, WOULD LEAD TO
PUNISHMENT?  (FINES, I SUPPOSE.)
