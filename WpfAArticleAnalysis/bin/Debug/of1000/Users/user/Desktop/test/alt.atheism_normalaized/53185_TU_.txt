ANY SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT A BETTER SOLUTION MIGHT BE?  I REALIZE THE
OFF-HAND NATURE OF THE NUMBERS I USED.  AND I CAN'T ANSWER AS TO WHAT
AN ACCEPTABLE LOSS RATE IS.  HOWEVER,  AS I SAID IN ANOTHER POST,  I
DESPISE THE IDEA OF SUPPORTING CRIMINALS FOR LIFE.  IT'S THE ECONOMICS
OF THE SITUATION THAT CONCERN ME MOST.  THE MONEY SPENT FEEDING, CLOTHING,
HOUSING AND TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE
UNFIT TO LIVE IN SOCIETY COULD GO TO A NUMBER OF PLACES,  ALL OF WHICH
I, AND PROBABLY OTHERS,  WOULD CONSIDER FAR MORE WORTHWHILE AND WHICH
WOULD ENRISH THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS.  GIVE PEOPLE JOBS,  GIVE THE
HOMELESS SHELTER.  ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.
