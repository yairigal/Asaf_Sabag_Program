Short reply to Kent Sandviks post remarking how it is strange that 
somehow Sufism is related to Islam as to him they seem quite 
different 
 
If one really understands Islam it is not strange that Sufism is 
associated with it  In fact Sufism is in general seen as the inner 
dimension of Islam 
 
One of the roots of the word Islam is submission  Islam 
denotes submission to God  Sufism is the most complete submission to 
God imaginable in annihilating oneself in God 
 
I am not a Sufi or on the Sufi path but have read a lot and recently 
have been discussing a number of things with others who are on the Sufi 
path
