 I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one I simply dont agree 
 with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force

 And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the 
 Holy Quran the Bible etc  There have been times in the spiritual 
 and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical 
 descriptions of Heaven Hell and Satan were taken quite literally 
 and that *worked* for the time  As I mentioned in the Tradition 
 cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory 
 about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil 
 which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic 
 
     Which begs the question if Satan in this case is 
     metaphorical how can you be certain Allah is not 
     the same way 
 
 The bottom line
