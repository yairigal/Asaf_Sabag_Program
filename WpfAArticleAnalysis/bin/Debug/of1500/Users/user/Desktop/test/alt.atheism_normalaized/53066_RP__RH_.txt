 There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread 
 that are a little confusing An atheist is one for whom all things can 
 be understood as processes of nature  exclusively 
 
This definition does not include all atheists see the FAQ However 
I for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or 
spiritual explanations  
 
It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood 
as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not 
require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual 
for that matter Humans are not omnipotent and neither is science 
However science has one advantage theology doesnt it is self 
correcting with nature as its judge  
 
It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self 
consistent simple picture of our universe Science is no longer 
a bunch of separate branches it is one From particle physics to 
psychology And no aspect of our life or our universe is safe 
from its stern and stony eye Not even our consciousness 
 
 There is no need 
 for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything There is 
 no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by 
 physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is 
 determnined 
 
Actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question 
and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow 
superdeterministic or not I think the question does not have 
any meaning as far as individual human beings go If their apparent 
free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their 
perspective Bill can you say for sure whether you have a free 
will or not  
 
 This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all 
 its products There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it 
 acquire intelligence its just a happy accident 
 
Maybe Who are we to tell It seems intelligence is useful  when 
during the history of Earth has one species been able to control 
one third of the whole biosphere This can still be a result of  
numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates 
and preserves Even that machinery can be result of the same 
principle  only the systems that can start replicating will 
survive those which dont dont make it Recommended reading to 
 
 For an atheist no 
 event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less 
 value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about 
 an event can have value  
 
From whose perspective I value events and things subjectively from 
my perspective Nature does not have values because it does not have 
a perspective  values arise from awareness If I have a subjective 
perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if 
I think about what it would it be like in their position I will 
eventually discover the Golden Rule Morality is not necessarily 
a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution 
Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity 
is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect 
others who seem to have identity too  
 
Bill have you ever read Aristotle Try his Ethica Nikomakhea sp 
for starters 
 
 How then can an atheist judge value What is the basis for criticizing 
 the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God On 
 what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned It 
 seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you 
 have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what 
 in nature can serve that purpose What law of nature can you invoke to 
 establish your values 
 
CS Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why 
he abandoned his atheism and became Christian The argument is 
severely flawed 
 
Some values such as the Golden Rule can have a rational basis Some 
others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its 
roots in the way our brains are wired Lewis ignored the very real 
possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic 
behaviour and morality as well Indeed as humans evolved better 
and better in building and using tools they also became better 
at killing each other It is a logical necessity that evolution could 
only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against ones 
own people 
 
The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews 
was not beyond this A simple set of rules to hold the people 
together under one god Their god did not care much about people 
of other nations  
 
At the time of the NT things were quite different  the Jews 
were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore 
the Gentiles A new situation required a new morality and along 
with it a new religion was born A mutation in a meme pool 
 
 Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what 
 difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or 
 otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value The only 
 way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the 
 objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesnt like it 
  thats it Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer 
 that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries 
 no weight in any absolute sense 
 
It looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy Whenever there 
is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may  
value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result 
of some physical event and others happiness too if the observer 
comes to think about it In an absolutely objective sense that is 
without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their 
meaning  
 
It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of 
view This includes gods too their values are only their  
personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths 
do not exist  
 
The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others 
is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence 
by becoming social beings who can think and value others 
existence 
 
Morality is not property of humans alone  chimps dolphins and 
many other species show great care for each other Dolphins have 
sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed  
 
 That you dont like what God told people to do says nothing about God 
 or Gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your 
 nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled 
 with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction That your 
 objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been 
 conditioned there is no truth content The whole of your 
 intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality 
 
The last statement does not logically follow In fact there is 
every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very 
well and our senses can convey reliable information Solipsism 
is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one 
 
You are continuously mixing two different views the subjective 
point of view which we all share and an objective point of view 
which does not exist Any observer or thinker any personal being 
has its own point of view It does not matter whether this point 
of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not 
cease to be subjective  
 
From a nonobservers nonpoint of view values do not exist Neither 
does pain or pleasure or beauty or love Such things are  
inherently subjective  
 
Once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even 
to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if 
we dont I disagree with his morals I do not think my morals come 
from any supreme being  to remove my morals means the same than 
to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought If god 
gave
