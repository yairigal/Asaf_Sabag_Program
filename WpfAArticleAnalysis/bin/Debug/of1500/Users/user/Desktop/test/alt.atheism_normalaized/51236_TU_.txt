THIS ISN'T TRUE.  MANY PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO USE THE "AUTOMOBILE SYSTEM."
I CERTAINLY DON'T USE IT BY CHOICE.  IF THERE WERE OTHER WAYS OF GETTING
AROUND, I'D DO IT.

BUT I THINK THAT THE COURT SYSTEM HAS BEEN REFINED--OVER HUNDREDS OF
YEARS IN THE US, BRITAIN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE
IT AS FAIR AS POSSIBLE.  CAN IT BE MADE BETTER (WITHOUT REMOVING THE
DEATH PENALTY)?  BESIDES, LIFE IMPRISONMENT SOUNDS LIKE A FATAL PUNISHMENT
TO ME.
