 Very true length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism  
 Atheists and Christians have been debating since  and still debate with

Ive seen referrences to Creation vs Evolution several times in aa 
and I have question Is either point of view derived from direct 
observation can either be scientific I wonder if the whole 
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the Truth 
rather than the truth itself  
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and I cant help 
wondering which came first As Ive pointed out elsewhere my view of 
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing 
anyhthing objectively  all knowledge is inherently subjective So in 
the context of aa would you take a stand based on what you actually 
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell 
the difference
