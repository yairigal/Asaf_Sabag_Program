I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd becasuse all 
the evidence Ive seen indicates that morality and moral systems are 
man made and thus subjective 
 
This is not a shot at Christianity I would apply it to any other person 
or group that advocates objective morality unless said persongroup 
can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim 
 
Actually Christians do claim an absolute morality but that is another 
matter
