Actually I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more 
interesting  Is there an independent source for this assertion 
or is it all from the Christian Bible  Is there any record at 
all of anything he built  A table a house some stairs Norm 
Abrams says the real test of a carpenters skill is building 
stairs with hand tools  Did he leave any plans behind for say 
kitchen counters and cabinets  Did he build his own cross 
If so did he use pressuretreated lumber  Gotta use that 
pressuretreated anywhere that wood meets concrete but it 
holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications  I keep 
seeing these bumperstickers that say My boss is a Jewish 
Carpenter but theyre always on the back of Ford Escorts 
and a real carpenters apprentice would probably drive a 
pickup so Im out for verification that he really was a 
carpenter
