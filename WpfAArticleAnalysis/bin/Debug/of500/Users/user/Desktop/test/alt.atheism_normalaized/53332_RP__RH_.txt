Since this is altatheism I hope you dont mind if we strongly disagree 
 
 The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to  
 But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love 
 you because you made them love you or because they wanted to 
 love you     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward

I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me 
shell know what to do

 that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic 
 Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is 
 the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
 know more than you do now
