In this era of AIDS isnt someones fucking *everyones* interest  semi 
 
 
I propose We have no motto 
 
Recently in the glorious state of Maryland the only state whose state song 
refers to Abraham Lincoln as a tyrant people have gotten all wound up over 
the state motto which we inherited from the Calverts 
 
    Fatti Maschii Parole Femine 
 
which if you read Italian says 
 
    Manly deeds womanly words 
 
or something to that effect  In the state which not so long ago had four 
women out of seven representatives this represents a problem  The official 
solution was to change the translation so now it means 
 
    Strong deeds gentle words 
 
My personal suggestion was changing it to walk softly and carry a big 
stick 
  
C Wingate        + The peace of God it is no peace 
                  +    but strife closed in the sod 
mangoecsumdedu +  Yet brothers pray for but one thing 
tovemangoe       +    the marvlous peace of God
