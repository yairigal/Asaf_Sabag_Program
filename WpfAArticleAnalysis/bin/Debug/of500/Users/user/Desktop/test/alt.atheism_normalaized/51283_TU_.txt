 SORRY, BILL, I HAD TO CLEAR THIS UP. THERE MAY BE GOOD EVOLUTIONARY
ARGUMENTS AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY, BUT THESE DON'T QUALIFY.

 OH? I GUESS ALL THOSE SOCIAL INSECTS (E.G. ANTS, BEES, ETC.) WHICH
HAVE ONE BREEDING QUEEN AND A WHOLE PASSEL OF STERILE WORKERS ARE ON
THE WAY OUT, HUH?

 I REFER YOU TO THE BONOBOS, A SPECIES OF PRIMATE AS CLOSELEY RELATED TO
HUMANS AS CHIMPANZEES (THAT IS, VERY CLOSELY). THEY HAVE SEX ALL THE
TIME, HOMOSEXUAL AS WELL AS HETEROSEXUAL. WHEN THE GROUP FINDS FOOD, THEY
HAVE SEX. BEFORE THE GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, THEY HAVE SEX. AFTER THEY
ESCAPE FROM OR FIGHT OFF PRDATORS, THEY HAVE SEX. SEX SERVES A VERY IMPORTANT
SOCIAL FUNCTION ABOVE AND BEYOND REPRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES. A SPECIES
CLOSELY RELATED TO HUMANS. THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT SEX PERFORMS
A SOCIAL FUNCTION IN HUMANS, AS WELL, BUT EVEN IF NOT, THIS SHOWS THAT
SUCH A FUNCTION IS NOT *IMPOSSIBLE*.

 SINCERELY,
