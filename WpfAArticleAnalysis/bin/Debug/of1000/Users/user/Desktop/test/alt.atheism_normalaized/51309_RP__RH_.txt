 Mr Connors assertion that more complex == later in paleontology 
 is simply incorrect  Many lineages are known in which whole 
 structures are lost  for example snakes have lost their legs 
 Cave fish have lost their eyes  Some species have almost completely 
 lost their males  Kiwis are descended from birds with functional 
 wings

The statements I made were illustrative of the inescapably 
anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process 
There is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other 
than teleological that is my whole point Even those who have reason 
to believe they understand evolution biologists for instance tend to 
personify nature and I cant help but wonder if its because of the 
limits of the language or the nature of nature
