So what The value I assign the results is as real *to me* as they can get 
Im just not limited to how things are valuable to me Aside from our own 
desires for its results science has no value Nevertheless it still 
accurately describes how the universe works humans or no humans   
 
You were doing fine until that last sentence  I believe this too 
but please prove it 
 
>  Which facts to observe 
 
Thats the value judgement youre confusing and a question for an 
individual researcher For science the answer is unequvocal all 
 
Impossible One observes the simple facts the ones that are likely to 
turn up again  Judgement call  You cant observe everything and you 
cant test every hypothesis  Therefore you select  Thats a bunch 
of subjective people judging the importance of obs and hypotheses  
can they do this reliably

You dont Thats why it takes substantially more than one observation 
before a newly observed phenomenon is judged to be real or noise I suppose 
you didnt know that there are still people out there making observations 
to further verify F=ma  
 
judged to be real or noise  How do I do this  Do you do it the same 
way as I do  How do we know this  Are we assuming an objective reality 
or something  Gee maybe we are and judgement is necessary to find out 
what it is
