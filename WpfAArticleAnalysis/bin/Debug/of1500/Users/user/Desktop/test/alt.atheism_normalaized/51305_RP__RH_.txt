But the goal need not be a subjective one  For instance the goal of 
natural morality is the propogation of a species perhaps  It wasnt 
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions 
to this were necessary  Intelligent animals have different needs than 
the others and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more 
complicated than the law of the jungle  I dont think that 
selfactualization is so subjective as you might think  And by 
objectivity I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be 
carried out completely
