#
#>                                        BUT YOU CAN'T ANSWER IT, AND YOUR 
#> ANSWER BE IN GENERAL TRUE.
#
#GOT IT IN ONE.  SIMILARLY, A MORAL RELATIVIST WILL NOT JUDGE ONE MORAL SYSTEM
#TO BE BETTER THAN ANOTHER IN EVERY POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS DOES NOT,
#HOWEVER, PRECLUDE HIM FROM JUDGING ONE MORAL SYSTEM TO BE BETTER THAN ANOTHER
#IN A SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  NOR DOES IT PRECLUDE A SET OF MORAL
#RELATIVISTS FROM COLLECTIVELY JUDGING A MORAL SYSTEM, FROM SOME SET OF
#CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THEY ALL AGREE THEY ARE IN.

O.K., THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME.  (I'M SERIOUS, YOU'VE EXPLAINED SOMETHING
TO ME WHICH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD BEFORE).  BUT JUST FOR GRINS, SUPPOSE WE
ALMOST ALL AGREE THAT WE ARE IN A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES CALLED "REALITY".  WHAT
THEN?  OR SAY, FOR ALL PRACTICAL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THERE IS NO FRAME
OF REFERENCE IN WHICH THUS AND SUCH IS GOOD, ISN'T THAT APPROXIMATELY
OBJECTIVE, IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE USUALLY EXPECT A SPEEDING BULLET TO
OUTRUN A SNAIL?  FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HEAR OF A BOMB IN A CROWDED AREA,
ISN'T IT A RATHER SENSIBLE FIRST GUESS THAT THIS IS AN IMMORAL ACT, EVEN
THOUGH THERE CONCEIVABLY MIGHT BE SOME TAIL-END CASE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY IT?

#>                             AND EVEN THAT STATEMENT ASSUMES AN
#> OBJECTIVE REALITY INDEPENDENT OF OUR BELIEFS ABOUT IT.
#
#EH?  COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS?  WHICH "THAT STATEMENT" ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

MY OWN, ABOVE. "YOU CAN'T ANSWER..."
#
#> #> AND WHAT WEASEL WORD DO YOU USE TO DESCRIBE THAT FRAME OF REFERENCE, IF
#> #> IT ISN'T AN OBJECTIVE REALITY FOR VALUES?
#> #
#> #I'M SORRY, I CAN'T PARSE "AN OBJECTIVE REALITY FOR VALUES".  COULD YOU TRY
#> #AGAIN?
#> 
#> S/AN OBJECTIVE REALITY FOR VALUES/SOME VALUES ARE REAL EVEN IN THE FACE
#> OF DISAGREEMENT/
#
#I STILL DON'T QUITE SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.  I ASSUME BY "VALUES" YOU
#MEAN MORAL VALUES, YES?  IN WHICH CASE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "REAL"?  WHAT IS
#A "REAL" MORAL VALUE, AS OPPOSED TO AN UNREAL ONE?

I MEAN TO SAY THAT VALUES ARE AS REAL AS HORSES, WHATEVER YOU UNDERSTAND
BY A HORSE BEING REAL IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I MEAN ABOUT A VALUE BEING REAL.

#> IF YOU ARE SAYING THAT SOME MORAL SYSTEMS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS, IN
#> YOUR OPINION, THEN ALL YOU GET IS INFINITE REGRESS.
#
#SORRY, BUT IN WHAT WAY IS IT AN INFINITE REGRESS?  IT LOOKS EXTREMELY FINITE
#TO ME.

I MEANT THAT IT'S NEVER MORE THAN YOUR OPINION.  YOU'VE CLARIFIED THIS
FOR ME ABOVE.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS NOW THAT IF A SUPERMAJORITY OF RELATIVISTS
AGREE THAT THUS AND SUCH IS WRONG IN ALMOST ANY OR ALL FRAMES OF REFERENCE,
THEN THEY'RE SAYING SOMETHING WHICH IS TO ALL PRACTICAL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M SAYING.
#
#>                                                    WHAT YOU DO NOT GET
#> IS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR SAYING THAT THE MORAL SYSTEM OF THE TERRORIST
#> IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE MAN OF PEACE.
#
#SORRY, BUT THAT'S NOT SO.  I CAN PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATION FOR ASSERTING THAT
#THE MORAL SYSTEM OF THE TERRORIST IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE MAN OF PEACE.  I
#JUST CAN'T PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATION WHICH WORKS IN ALL POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

LOGICALLY POSSIBLE, OR ACTUALLY POSSIBLE?  BY WHICH I MEAN, ARE YOU
STRETCHING POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE EVENTS SUCH AS THE ATOMS IN MY TERMINAL
SWITCHING PLACES SO THAT THE TERMINAL TURNS UPSIDE DOWN, OR DO YOU
THINK IT LIKELY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ARISE IN WHICH TERRORISM IS
SUPERIOR TO PEACE.  REALLY WHAT I'M AFTER IS SOME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE
ON THE PROBABILITY YOU PUT ON 'POSSIBLE'.
