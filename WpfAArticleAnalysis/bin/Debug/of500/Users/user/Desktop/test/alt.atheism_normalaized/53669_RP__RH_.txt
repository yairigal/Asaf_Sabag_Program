No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against it   But let 
me ask you a question  Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for 
that matter anything in school  I mean its just what other people have told 
you and you dont want to swallow what others say right   
 
The life  death and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact  As much 
as anything else you learn  How do you choose what to believe and what not to 
I could argue that George Washington is a myth  He never lived because I dont 
have any proof except what I am told   However all the major events of the life 
of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him  Neat trick uh 
 
There is no way to get into a sceptical heart  You can not say you have given a  
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  You must TRUST not just go  
to church and participate in its activities  Were you ever willing to die
