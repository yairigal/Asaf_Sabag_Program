	ONE NEED NOT HAVE HAVE THE NOTION THAT SCIENCE IS USEFUL. FOR 
EXAMPLE: MANY CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS DO NOT BELIEVE MEDICAL SCIENCE TO BE 
USEFOR OR WORTHY. THAT DOES NOT MAKE MEDICAL SCIENCE SUBJECTIVE.

	IN ANY EVENT, I FAIL TO SEE WHAT YOU MEAN BY "SUBJECTIVE" SCIENCE.
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IT IS, AND THAT IF I STEP OF A BUILDING, I MAY FALL, 
WHILE YOU MAY NOT?

	I ASSURE YOU, IT IS A VERY OBJECTIVE CONCLUSION THAT YOU WILL FALL 
( WITHOUT ANY OTHER OUTSIDE MEANS OF SUPPORT ). IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THIS, 
I SUGGEST YOU STEP OFF OF A BUILDING, AND SUBJECTIVELY BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL 
NOT FALL.
