First of all Im not your buddy  Second read what I wrote  Im not 
talking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do merely what *SOME* 
practice  They consider themselves as muslim as you so dont retort 
with the old and tired they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS bullshit  If I 
gave you the names what will you do with this information  Is a fatwa 
going to be leashed out against the perpetrators  Do you honestly think 
that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess  
With the kind of extremism shown by your coreligionaries  Fat chance 
 
At any rate there can be no conclusive proof by the very nature of 
the act  Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in 
theory but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end 
 
I think its rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims 
in this regard  Also kind of silly  Are you insinuating that because 
the Koranic law forbids it there are no criminals in muslim countries  
 
This is as far as I care to go on this subject  The weakness of your 
arguments are for all netters to see  Over and out
