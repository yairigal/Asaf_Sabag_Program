Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when 
Einstein proved that there isnt an objective frame of reference 
 
Not that Einstein proved anything but you cant answer it and your  
answer be in general true  And even that statement assumes an 
objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

Im sorry I cant parse an objective reality for values  Could you try 
again 
 
san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face 
of disagreement 
 
If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in 
your opinion then all you get is infinite regress  What you do not get 
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist 
is inferior to that of the man of peace  Your saying it does not 
make it so  and thats according to your premise not mine
