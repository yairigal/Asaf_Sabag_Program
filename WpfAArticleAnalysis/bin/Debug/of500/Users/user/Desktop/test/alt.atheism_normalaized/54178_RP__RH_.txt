While Ill agree that these are generally held to be good things I 
question whether they come very close to being objective values 
Especially considering that at one time or another each has been 
viewed as being undesirable  I doubt you could even come up with 
anything that could be said to be universally good or bad 
 
And when I referred to the truth I was using the term 
hypothetically realizing full well that there may not even be such a 
thing

True enough  But they cannot be said to be anything more than 
personal morals  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any 
sense of personal accountability  the justification for any 
socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority 
aka absolute moral truth
