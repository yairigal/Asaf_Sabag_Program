YES, UNLESS THE OBSERVER IS AT REST WITH RESPECT TO THE SINGULARITY AT
INFINITE DISTANCE AWAY. BUT AN OBSERVER ON A CLOSE APPROACH TO THE BH WILL
SEE THE PARTICLE GO IN IN FINITE TIME.

DON'T FORGET TO SING:
            THEY SAY THERE'S A HEAVEN FOR THOSE WHO WILL WAIT
                SOME SAY IT'S BETTER, BUT I SAY IT AIN'T
        I'D RATHER LAUGH WITH THE SINNERS THAN CRY WITH THE SAINTS
                     THE SINNERS ARE MUCH MORE FUN
                         ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG!
