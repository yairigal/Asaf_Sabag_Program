That complicated isnt in fact where PH > PHG comes from its more 
the other way around Its from 
 
  PH  =  PHG +  PHG  where G is the complement of G 
 
and by axiom Panything >= 0 so PHG >= 0 so PH >= PHG 
 
In a sense HG is necessarily more complicated than H for any H and G 
so I may be splitting hairs but what Im trying to say is that irrespective 
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is PH >= PHG 
holds with equality if and only if PHG = 0

Well Px | A = Px | B means that x is as likely to be observed if A is 
operative as it is if B is operative This implies that observing x does not 
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between 
the respective possibilities that A and B are operative the difference 
reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior 
probabilities PA and PB 
 
  Px | A = Px | B  ==> 
 
    PA | x  =  k PA   and   PB | x  =  k PB 
 
where k  =  Px | A  Px  =  Px | B  Px 
 
So A and B are equally consistent with the data in that observing x 
doesnt give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative 
 
In the particular case where A = H and B = HG however we know that their 
prior probabilities are ordered by PH >= PHG although we dont know 
the actual values and its this which allows us to deploy the Razor to 
throw out any such HG

Thats certainly true but the particular point here was whether or 
not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion 
in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious 
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word 
 
Now it seems to me as Ive said that the observed variance in religious 
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather 
*less* well if one proposes a divine component in addition since I would 
expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual 
exclusion among beliefs Thus my *personal* feeling is that Px | HG isnt 
even equal to Px | H in this case but is smaller H is memetic transmission 
G is divine component x is the variance among beliefs But I happily 
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression

Not that Im a statistician as such either but 
 
The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of 
the read my observations to date However theism of the type with 
which I am concerned *also* suggests that for instance prayer may be 
answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable 
to statistical verification and that gods may generally intervene in 
measurable ways 
 
This means that these regions of the space of possible observations  
which I loosely termed appearances of gods have some nonzero 
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic 
 
Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to 
scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism 
expends on making appearances of gods possible must come from somewhere 
else ie other possible observations 
 
All else being equal this means that an observation which *isnt* an 
appearance of gods must have a slightly higher probability under 
atheism than under theism The Bayesian stuff implies that such 
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of 
the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease 
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis 
 
Sorry if thats still a bit jargonesque but its rather difficult to 
put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties 
of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total 
area under them is always unity 
 
An analogy may or may not  be helpful Say that hypothesis A is the 
coin is fair and that B is the coin is unfair twoheaded Ive 
used A and B to avoid confusion with Hheads and Ttails 
 
Then 
 
  PH | A = 05    total 1 
  PT | A = 05   
 
  PH | B = 1      total 1 
  PT | B = 0     
 
The observations are a string of heads with no tails This is compatible 
with both a fair coin A and a twoheaded coin B However the probability 
expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails even though they 
dont actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must 
be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance 
of heads 
 
Say our running estimates at time n1 are en1A and en1B The 
observation xn at time n is another head xn = H The estimates are 
modified according to 
 
                            PH | A 
  enA   =   en1A *    =   en1A * m 
                              PH 
 
and 
 
                            PH | B 
  enB   =   en1B *    =   en1B * 2m 
                              PH 
 
Now we dont know PH the *actual* prior probability of a head but 
the multiplier for eA is half that for eB This is true every time 
the coin is tossed and a head is observed 
 
Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have 
 
                 n 
  enA   =
