Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous  Rewriting more carefully we have 
at least two possibilities  The first 
 
Things called Mercedes are cars 
That girl is called Mercedes 
Therefore that girl is a car 
 
That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction  It is not sound 
because the first statement is false  Similarly I would hold that Jims 
example is valid but not sound 
 
Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is 
 
There exists at least one car called Mercedes 
That girl is called Mercedes 
Therefore that girl is a car 
 
 which isnt valid
