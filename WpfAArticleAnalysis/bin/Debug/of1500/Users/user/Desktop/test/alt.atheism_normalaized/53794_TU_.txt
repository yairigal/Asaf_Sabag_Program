>>YES.

>WELL, MAKE IT.

ETHICS DEAL WITH INDIVIDUALS.  MORALS DEAL WITH GROUPS.

>>>WELL, OUR MORAL SYSTEM SEEMS TO MIMIC THE NATURAL ONE, IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.
>>PLEASE DESCRIBE THESE "NUMBER OF WAYS" IN DETAIL.  THEN EXPLAIN THE ANY
>>CONTRADICTIONS THAT MAY ARISE.

>JUST LOOK AT HOW HUMAN BEHAVIOR MIMICS ANIMAL BEHAVIOR.  I COULDN'T EVEN

>TO OUR HIGH INTELLIGENCE.

PLEASE DESCRIBE THESE "NUMBER OF WAYS" IN DETAIL.  THEN EXPLAIN ANY
CONTRADICTIONS THAT MAY ARISE.

>>>I DON'T KNOW.  WHAT IS WRONG?  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO SURVIVE FOR
>>>A LONG TIME IN THE WILD?  YES, IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT.  HUMANS
>>>ARE A SOCIAL ANIMAL, AND THAT IS A CAUSE OF OUR SUCCESS.
>>DEFINE "DIFFICULT".
>
>I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

THE SENTENCE, "YES, IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT."  HUMANS SURVIVED
"IN THE WILD" FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

>>>NO.  AS NOTED EARLIER, LACK OF MATING (SUCH AS ABSTINENCE OR HOMOSEXUALITY)
>>>ISN'T REALLY DESTRUCTIVE TO THE SYSTEM.  IT IS A WORST NEUTRAL.
>>SO IF EVERY MEMBER OF THE SPECIES WAS HOMOSEXUAL, THIS WOULDN'T BE DESTRUCTIVE
>>TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES?
>
>MOST ANIMALS THAT EXHIBIT HOMOSEXUALITY ARE ACTUALLY BISEXUAL.

ANSWER THE QUESTION, KEITH.  IS HOMOSEXUALITY DETRIMENTAL TO THE SURVIVAL
OF THE SPECIES?
