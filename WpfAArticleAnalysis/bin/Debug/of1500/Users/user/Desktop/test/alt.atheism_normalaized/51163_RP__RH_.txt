	A human has greater control over hisher actions than a  
predominately instictive tiger 
 
	A proper analogy would be 
 
	If you are thrown into a cage with a person and get mauled do you  
blame that person 
 
	Yes  providing that that person was in a responsible frame of  
mind eg not clinicaly insane on PCBs etc  
 
 
 
        One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that  
        say Mom because of the love of their mom  It makes for more  
        virile men
