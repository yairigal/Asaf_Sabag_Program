Indeed  But that code is law not morality  I think the point here was not  
a discussion of anarchy vs law  I think that most see the benefit of a non 
anarchistic system  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on  
technology derived from an ordered existance  We woulnt have got far if  
we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs right 
 
The question becomes is it possible to have an ordered society in which  
the laws are recognized to be in place based on enlightened self interest  
as opposed to morality  
 
And secondly assuming a satisfactory legal code is in place and we  
choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible is a moral  
code required or even acceptable 
 
Can an agreement ever be reached  At what point do we start to comprimise 
 
Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues
