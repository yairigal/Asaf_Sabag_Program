abstract and the clear 
 discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated 
 
The principles of Application of the law involves 
 principles of exemption 
 principles of precaution 
 principles of option 
 principles of mastery 
 
The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process 
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation It is not a matter 
of looking at one verse and one hadith  
 
Now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference 
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is 
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself There is the 
famous hadith of the Prophet SA in which he says 
The fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the Prophet as  
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures 
and wealth of this world The Prophet SA was asked O Messenger 
of God How may we know if they so concern themselves He SA replied 
By seeing whether they follow the ruling power If they do that fear for 
your religion and shun them I do not yet know enough about the Imams 
of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies 
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them 
 
The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam My only 
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into 
play a certain amount of expertise  the specifics of this expertise is  
delineated in the Quran and hadith Those who acquire this expertise 
are praised in both the Quran and hadith  those who without the requisite 
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion  
are cautioned 
 
The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this 
group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is 
apostasy was wrong When one discusses something they should at least 
base their discussion on fact Secondly Khomeini was condemned as a 
heretic 
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible  another instance of 
creating a straw man and then beating him 
 
> Perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  Please 
> email me Rashid if you think we should do this 
 
I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup 
Unfortunately 
I do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated 
group 
is out of the question I cannot post to a moderated group like 
socreligionislam How about socculturearabic or talkreligionmisc 
 
As salaam alaikum
