There is no objective way of measuring the goodness of a moral 
system  Its a value judgement  Therefore there is so objective 
comparison for moral systems  Therefore there is no best moral 
system

objectively compare frames of reference  Any such choice is 
arbitrary 
 
Which is NOT to say that one should not take up reference frames for 
various purposes 
 
There is nothing to believe  not even this statement
