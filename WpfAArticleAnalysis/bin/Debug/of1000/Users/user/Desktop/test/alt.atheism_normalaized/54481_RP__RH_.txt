Sorry Gregg it was no answer to a post of mine And you are quite 
fond of using abusing language whenever you think your religion is 
misrepresented By the way I have no trouble telling me apart from

I still wait for your answer to that the Quran allows you to beat your wife 
into submission You were quite upset about the claim that it was in it 
to be more correct you said it wasnt 
  
I asked you about what your consequences were in case it would be in the 
Quran but you have simply ceased to respond on that thread Can it be 
that you have found out in the meantime that it is the Holy Book 
  
What are your consequences now Was your being upset just a show Do you 
simple inherit your morals from a Book ie is it suddenly ok now Is it 
correct to say that the words of Muhammad reflect the primitive Machism 
of his society Or have you spent your time with your new gained freedom
