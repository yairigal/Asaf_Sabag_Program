  The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the 
  incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb 
  through my archives and pull out some of The Best of AltAtheism 
  for your reading pleasure  Ill post a couple of these a day 
  unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good 
  material 
 
  I havent been particularly careful in the past about saving 
  attributions  I think the following comes from John A Johnson 
  but someone correct me if Im wrong  This is probably the longest 
  of my entire collection 
 
 
 
 
                                  So that the 
                                  Prophecy be 
                                   Fulfilled

       In considering the Christian religion and judging it 
according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at 
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy  The scribe Matthew is perhaps 
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in 
the career of Jesus of Nazareth  As you will see Matthews main 
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even 
about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in 
the New Testament  We must also bear in mind the question of the 
authenticity of the accounts  Since the gospels were written at 
least 35 years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much 
happened exactly as stated  But for purposes of analysis we 
will take particular claims at face value 
 
Immanuel 
 
       We begin of course at the beginning 
 
       Mt 12122  Mary will bear a son and you 
       Joseph will name him Jesus which means Gd is
