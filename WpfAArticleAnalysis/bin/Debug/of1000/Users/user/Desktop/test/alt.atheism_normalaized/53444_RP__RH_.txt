This is simply complete nonsense The basis for matters of fact is 
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion 
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge 
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

Opinions about raw facts as you call them are somewhat different 
than interpretations of those raw facts

That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to 
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to 
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good 
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

See above We cant seem to agree on whats better

I dont see that its any evidence at all 
As I point out above Im really not interested very much in 
what the popular opinion is Im prepared to trustto some extent 
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation 
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone 
else said the dial read 15 and it looked like a 3 to me I would 
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about 
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting 
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists 
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree 
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion 
about good from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion 
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get 
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations 
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually

Perhaps true but I didnt make assertions about what you believed 
You did
