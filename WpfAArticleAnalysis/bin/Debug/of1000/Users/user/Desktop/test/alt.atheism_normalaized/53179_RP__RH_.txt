The little things above were in reference to Germany clearly  People 
said that there were similar things in Germany but no one could name any 
They said that these were things that everyone should know and that they 
werent going to waste their time repeating them  Sounds to me like no one 
knew either  I looked in some books but to no avail

It has *caused* problems  Again no one has shown that things were better 
before the motto or that theyd likely be better after  I dont think 
the motto initiates any sort of harassment  Harassment will occur whether 
or not the motto is present
