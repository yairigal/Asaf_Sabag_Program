    We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot 
    explain origins  For a person to exclude anything but science from 
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth 
    than science  This is a false premise  By the way I enjoy science 
    It is truly a wonder observing Gods creation  Macroevolution is 
    a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion guaranteed 
    within three percent error
