AH! EXCELLENT. SO WHY DOESN'T SHE APPEAR TO ME? I'M A LITTLE WEAK IN THE
BLIND FAITH DEPARTMENT. (BESIDES, SHE DOESN'T EVEN REALLY NEED TO APPEAR:
HOW ABOUT, OH SAY, A LITTLE TIP - SOMETHING LIKE "PUT YOUR ALL ON #3 IN THE
7:30 AT THE DOG RACES" ... PERHAPS IN A DREAM OR VISION.)

>>HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

>WOULD A PERSON WHO WAS HIGH WRITE SO WELL AND WITH SUCH CONSISTENCY?

I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW ARABIC; I HAVE ONLY READ TRANSLATIONS. I WOULDN'T
KNOW IT IF IT WERE WELL-WRITTEN. (CONSISTENT, THOUGH, IS ONE THING THE QURAN
IS NOT.)  AND HAVE *YOU* READ IT IN ARABIC?  BESIDES, SOME OF MY BEST
WRITING HAS BEEN DONE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF, SHALL WE SAY, CONSCIOUSNESS
ALTERING SUBSTANCES.

>>AND HOW

>>PUT IN THEIR OWN LITTLE VERSES?

>THEY'D HAVE TO BE VERY GOOD TO DO SO WITHOUT DESTROYING THE BEAUTY

YES, SO? HOW DO WE KNOW THEY *WEREN'T* VERY GOOD? (AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT THE
QURAN IS BEAUTFULLY WRITTEN.)

>>AND WHY CAN MUHAMMED MARRY MORE THAN FOUR WOMEN,

>MUHAMMAD DID NOT EXCEED THE NUMBER _AFTER_ THE REVELATION REGULATING

OK, I RETRACT THIS POINT. (ALTHOUGH I MIGHT STILL SAY THAT ONCE HE KNEW, HE
SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT.)

>>(ALTHOUGH I THINK THE BIGGEST

>>MENTION MURDER THE AUTHOR.)
>
>I AGREE. BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THIS IS THE CASE?

I HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED ALL MUSLIMS ABOUT THIS; I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT IF THIS
WERE FALSE. BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT ON YOUR SAY-SO - WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES?

>ANOTHER CASE OF JUDGING PRINCIPLES ON THE BASIS OF THOSE WHO CLAIM
>TO FOLLOW THEM.

WHAT OTHER BASIS DO WE HAVE TO JUDGE A SYSTEM? ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CAN'T GET
A CONSISTENT PICTURE OF WHAT ISLAM "REALLY" IS. DO I BELIEVE KHOMEINI? DO I
GO BY THE IMAM OF THE MOSQUE IN MECCA? OR PERHAPS THE GUY IN NEW JERSEY? OR
PERHAPS YOU SAY I SHOULD GO ONLY BY THE QURAN. OK, WHOSE TRANSLATION? AND
WHAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE "AND WHEREVER YOU FIND IDOLATORS, KILL THEM"?
