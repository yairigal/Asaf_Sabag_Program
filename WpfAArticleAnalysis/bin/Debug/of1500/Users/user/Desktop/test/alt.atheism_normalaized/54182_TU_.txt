>>SCHNEIDER
>>>NATURAL MORALITY MAY SPECIFICALLY BE THOUGHT OF AS A CODE OF ETHICS THAT
>>>A CERTAIN SPECIES HAS DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.
>>WAIT.  ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ETHICS OR MORALS HERE?
>
>IS THE DISTINCTION IMPORTANT?

YES.

>>>WE SEE THIS COUNTLESS
>>>TIMES IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, AND SUCH A "NATURAL" SYSTEM IS THE BASIS FOR
>>>OUR OWN SYSTEM AS WELL.
>>HUH?
>
>WELL, OUR MORAL SYSTEM SEEMS TO MIMIC THE NATURAL ONE, IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

PLEASE DESCRIBE THESE "NUMBER OF WAYS" IN DETAIL.  THEN EXPLAIN THE ANY
CONTRADICTIONS THAT MAY ARISE.

>>>IN ORDER FOR HUMANS TO THRIVE, WE SEEM TO NEED
>>>TO LIVE IN GROUPS,
>>HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.  "WE *SEEM* TO NEED".  WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE HIGHLIGHTED
>>WORD?
>
>I DON'T KNOW.  WHAT IS WRONG?  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO SURVIVE FOR
>A LONG TIME IN THE WILD?  YES, IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT.  HUMANS
>ARE A SOCIAL ANIMAL, AND THAT IS A CAUSE OF OUR SUCCESS.

DEFINE "DIFFICULT".

>>>AND IN ORDER FOR A GROUP TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY, IT
>>>NEEDS SOME SORT OF ETHICAL CODE.
>>THIS STATEMENT IS NOT CORRECT.
>
>ISN'T IT?  WHY DON'T YOU THINK SO?

EXPLAIN THE LAWS IN AMERICA STATING THAT YOU HAVE TO DRIVE ON THE RIGHT-
HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD.

>>>AND, BY POINTING OUT THAT A SPECIES' CONDUCT SERVES TO PROPOGATE ITSELF,
>>>I AM NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU YOUR TAUTOLOGY, BUT I AM TRYING TO SHOW THAT
>>>SUCH ARE EXAMPLES OF MORAL SYSTEMS WITH A GOAL.  PROPOGATION OF THE SPECIES
>>>IS A GOAL OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF MORALITY.
>>SO ANYBODY WHO LIVES IN A MONAGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT MORAL?  AFTER ALL,
>>IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROPOGATION OF THE SPECIES, EVERY MAN SHOULD IMPREGNATE
>>AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE.
>
>NO.  AS NOTED EARLIER, LACK OF MATING (SUCH AS ABSTINENCE OR HOMOSEXUALITY)
>ISN'T REALLY DESTRUCTIVE TO THE SYSTEM.  IT IS A WORST NEUTRAL.

SO IF EVERY MEMBER OF THE SPECIES WAS HOMOSEXUAL, THIS WOULDN'T BE DESTRUCTIVE
TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES?

>>FOR THAT MATTER, IN HERDS OF HORSES, ONLY THE DOMINATE STALLION MATES.  WHEN
>>HE DIES/IS KILLED/WHATEVER, THE NEW DOMINATE STALLION IS THE ONLY ONE WHO
>>MATES.  THESE SEEMS TO BE A CASE OF YOUR "NATURAL SYSTEM OF MORALITY" TRYING
>>TO SHOOT ITSELF IN THE FIGURATIVE FOOT.
>
>AGAIN, THE MATING PRACTICES ARE SOMETHING TO BE REEXAMINED...

THE WHOLE "THEORY" NEEDS TO BE REEXAMINED...
