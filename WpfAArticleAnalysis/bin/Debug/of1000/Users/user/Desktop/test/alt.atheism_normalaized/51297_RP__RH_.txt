To put it as simply as possible *I am not a Muslim* I do not 
 accept the charge of apostacy because I have never in my adult life 
 affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be 
 said to have apostasized from  The Islam I know states clearly that 
 there can be no coercion in matters of religion  The many Muslims 
 I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their 
 faith *purely by virtue of birth* and that a person who freely chose 
 not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death

God Satan Paradise and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth 
 year when I quite abruptly lost my faith  and afterwards to 
 prove my newfound atheism I bought myself a rather tasteless ham 
 sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of 
 the swine  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down  From that 
 day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person

Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the 
nature of the novel could think such a thing  Ill accept it 
reluctantly from mobs in Pakistan but not from you  What is 
presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the 
wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the 
actual Mohammad  Whats worse the novel doesnt present the 
MahoundMohammed character in any worse light than secular histories 
of Islam in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his 
life or that of his wives 
 
>That is why 
>few people rush to his defense  hes considered an absolute fool for  
>his writings in The Satanic Verses  
 
Dont hold back hes considered an apostate and a blasphemer 
However its not for his writing in The Satanic Verses but for 
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is 
contained in that book  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who 
has convinced me that they have read the book  Some have initially 
claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book 
than a superficial Newsweek story might impart and all have made 
factual misstatements about events in the book

Ill keep an eye out for it  I have a counterproposal I suggest 
that you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called The 
Satanic Verses  Perhaps then youll understand
