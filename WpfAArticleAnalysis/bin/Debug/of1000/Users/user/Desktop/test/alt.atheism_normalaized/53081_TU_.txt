  IF THE EMPHASIS IS ON THE "IN GENERAL", THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE
  CORRECT, SINCE YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SAID ANYTHING.  IF WE RESTRICT
  OUR OBSERVATIONS TO PRACTICED RELIGIONS, THERE ARE LOTS OF
  EXAMPLES OF GOD MANDATED GENOCIDE.  JUST ASK THE CANAANITES.  THE
  POINT IS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN A GOD, AND IF YOU BELIEVE HE HAS
  ORDERED YOU TO ELIMINATE AN ENTIRE RACE, YOU WILL LIKELY MAKE THE
  ATTEMPT.  AFTER ALL, IF IT WAS OK IN THE PAST, IT COULD SURELY BE
  OK IN THE PRESENT.
