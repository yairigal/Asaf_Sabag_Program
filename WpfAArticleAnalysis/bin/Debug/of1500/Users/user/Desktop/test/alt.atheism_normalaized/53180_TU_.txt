>>I THINK YOU SHOULD SUPPORT YOUR FIRST CLAIM, THAT PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY
>>HARASS ME NO MATTER WHAT, AS I DOUBT THIS IS TRUE. I THINK *SOME* OF THE
>>THEISTS WILL BE AT A LOSS, AND THAT IS ENOUGH REASON FOR ME.
>BECAUSE "IN GOD WE TRUST" IS A MOTTO ON THE COINS, AND THE COINS
>ARE A REPRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, CHRISTIANS ARE GIVEN
>AMMUNITION HERE TO SLANDER ATHEISTS AS UNPATRIOTIC.

SO, WE SHOULD BAN THE AMMUNITION?  WHY NOT GET RID OF THE GUNS?

>AND YES, I HAVE HEARD THIS USED IN CONVERSATION WITH CHRISTIANS.
>SURE, THEY MAY FALL BACK ON OTHER THINGS, BUT THIS IS ONE THEY
>SHOULD NOT HAVE AVAILABLE TO USE.

IT IS WORSE THAN OTHERS?  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?  SHOULD IT BE CHANGED TOO?
GOD BLESS AMERICA?  THE LIST GOES ON...

>IMAGINE IF THE NEXT YEAR'S SET OF COINS WERE LABELED WITH
>THE MOTTO:   "GOD IS DEAD".
>CERTAINLY, SUCH A STATEMENT ON U.S. COINS WOULD OFFEND ALMOST
>EVERY CHRISTIAN.  AND I'D BE TEMPTED TO RUB THAT MOTTO IN THE
>FACE OF CHRISTIANS WHEN DEBUNKING THEIR STANDARD MOTTO SLINGING
>GETS BORING.

THEN YOU'D BE NO BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE YOU DESPISE.

>ANY STATEMENT PRINTED ON AN ITEM THAT REPRESENTS
>THE GOVERNMENT IS AN ENDORSEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

OH?

>THE COIN MOTTO IS AN ENDORSEMENT OF TRUSTING IN GOD.

AN ENDORSEMENT, OR AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?  I THINK GODS ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE
ARE PROUD OF, BUT I DON'T THINK THE MOTTO ENCOURAGES BELIEF.

>I DON'T PARTICULARLY FEEL LIKE TRUSTING IN GOD,
>SO THE GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING ME DOWN WITH EVERY
>COIN IT PRINTS.

IS IT?

[...]
>FOR THE MOTTO TO BE LEGITIMATE, IT WOULD HAVE TO READ:
>   "IN GOD, GODS, OR GODLESSNESS WE TRUST"

WOULD YOU APPROVE OF SUCH A MOTTO?

>WHETHER THE MOTTO WAS INTENDED TO BE ANTI-ATHEIST OR NOT,
>IT TURNS UP AS AN OPEN INVITATION TO USE AS AN ANTI-ATHEIST TOOL.

AND REMOVING THE TOOL WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM?

OR WILL IT INCREASE THE PROBLEM?
