I'M AFRAID IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN THIS! JESUS SAID FOLLOW THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS AND THE TORAH AND THE PROPHETS. CHRISTIANS ON THE OTHER
HAND ARE NOT ONLY ABOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AND THE TORAH AND THE
PROPHETS, I.E. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW IT, THEY
DON'T EVEN FOLLOW THE SUBJECTIVE MORALITY OF JESUS! SO, WE SEE THAT
CHRISTIANS CAN'T FOLLOW THE "OBJECTIVE MORALITY" OF THEIR OWN TEN
COMMANDMENTS, THEY CAN'T FOLLOW THE "SUBJECTIVE MORALITY" OF JESUS WHEN
HE SAID FOLLOW THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, YET THEY EXPECT THE REST OF THE
WORLD TO DO; WHAT? IS THERE ANY LOGIC HERE? IS THERE ANY MORALITY HERE,
OBJECTIVE OR SUBJECTIVE? IS CHRISTIANITY SOMEBODY'S IDEA OF A JOKE? WHO
COULD BE PULLING THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF SO MANY CHRISTIANS? WHO COULD
BE SUCH A GREAT DECEIVER?
