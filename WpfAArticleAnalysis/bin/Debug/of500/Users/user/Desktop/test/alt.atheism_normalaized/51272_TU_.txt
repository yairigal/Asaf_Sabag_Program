COULD YOU EXPAND ON YOUR DEFINITION OF KNOWING? IT SEEMS A BIT MONOLITHIC
HERE, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU INTEND THAT. DON'T WE NEED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN "KNOWING" 2 PLUS 2 EQUALS 4 (OR 2 APPLES PLUS 2 APPLES
EQUALS 4 APPLES), THE FRENCH "KNOWING" THAT JERRY LEWIS IS AN AUTEUR, AND
WHAT IT MEANS TO SAY WE "KNOW" WHAT SOCRATES SAID?

I LIKE THIS EPIGRAPH. PERHAPS THE ISSUE IS LEARNING WHICH, IF ANY,
ABSURDITIES MERIT FURTHER EXPLORATION...GENE
