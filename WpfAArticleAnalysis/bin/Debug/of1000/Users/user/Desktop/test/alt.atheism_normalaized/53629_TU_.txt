>NAH.  I WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT ATHEISM TO SEE HOW LITTLE ATHEISTS
>HAVE UP THEIR SLEEVES.  WHATEVER I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED IS ACTUALLY QUITE

RIDDLE ME THIS.  IF A GOD(S) EXIST WHY ON EARTH SHOULD WE GROVEL?  WHY ON EARTH
SHOULD WE GIVE A DAMM AT ALL?  WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT IF SUCH A
CREATURE(S) EXIST IT DESERVES ANYTHING BEYOND MILD ADMIRATION OR SHEER
HATRED FOR WHAT IT/THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST (WHICHEVER GOD(S) YOU CARE TO
PICK).  THAT IS ASSUMING ANY RECORDS OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE CORRECT.

RELIGON OFFERS A BLISS BUBBLE OF SELF CONTAINED REALITY WHICH IS SEPERATE
FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD.  ANY BELIEF SYSTEM CAN LEAVE YOU IN SUCH A STATE
AND SO CAN DRUGS.  GOD(S) ARE NOT A REQUIREMENT.  ONLY IF YOU REMOVE SUCH
USELESS TAPPESTRY CAN YOU BUILD A SET OF MORALS TO BUILD A SOCIETY UPON.
IT IS THAT OR KEEP ON EXTERMINATING THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE (OR CONVERTING
THEM).
