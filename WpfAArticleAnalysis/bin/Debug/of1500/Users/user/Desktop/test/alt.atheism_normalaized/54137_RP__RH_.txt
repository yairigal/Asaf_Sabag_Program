Yup I think youre right  My mistake  Now how do I make 
an R backwards using a computer keyboard 
 
Ill bet the gods know how this is altatheism after 
all  Tell you what if all my Rs start coming out 
backwards when I type from now on Ill become a believer 
 
And thats not asking for miracles  If I asked for a miracle 
Id ask for a real miracle like for Pat Buchanan to become 
an outofthecloset drag queen  wellmaybe that wouldnt be 
so miraculous but I think hed look fabulous in a feather 
boa and a sequined hat like Mia Farrow wore in Gatsby
