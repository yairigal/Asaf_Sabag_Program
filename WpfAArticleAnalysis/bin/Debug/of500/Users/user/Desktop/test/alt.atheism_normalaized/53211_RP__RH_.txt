Pardon me   *I* am trying to apply human terms to nonhumans 
 
I think there must be some confusion here   Im the guy who is 
saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does *not* 
have any moral sugnificance   How does refusing to apply human 
terms to animals get turned into applying human terms

Im sure you do think this if you say so   How about trying to 
convince me

Ive offered four times I think to accept your definition if 
you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion 
of the planets

Ah the law of silly and less silly
