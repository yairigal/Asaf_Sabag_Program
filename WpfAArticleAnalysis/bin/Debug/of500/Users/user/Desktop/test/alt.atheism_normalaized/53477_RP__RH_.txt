One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions 
is called Mans Religions by John B Noss  It was a textbook in a class 
I had on comparative religion or some such thing  It has some decent 
bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading 
 
It doesnt compare religions directly but describes each one individually 
and notes a few similarities  But nothing I have read in it could be even 
remotely described as preachy or Christian based  In fact Christianity 
mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages  The book is 
divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  
India East Asia Near East  There is nothing about New World religions 
from the Aztecs Mayas Incas etc  Just the stuff people kill each 
other over nowadays  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along 
the way   
 
If you like the old stuff then a couple of books called The Ancient Near 
East by James B Pritchard are pretty cool  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh 
Code of Hammurabi all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods 
were men  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own 
religion and make it sound real good
