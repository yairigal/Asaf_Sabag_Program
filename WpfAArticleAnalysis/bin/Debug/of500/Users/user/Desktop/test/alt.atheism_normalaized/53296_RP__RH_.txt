	Wouldnt it be nice if Subject lines had something to do 
with nessage bodies 
 
	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole 
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called 
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever 
 
	Suppose that such a space existed and that our universe 
looked like a Black Hole in it Then our Universe could be open 
to it through Hawking radiation the same way Black Holes are 
within our Universe Note this is all the purist speculation 
and noone knows what laws govern QM beyond the event horizon 
of our universe Can laws change at such boundaries of spacetime
