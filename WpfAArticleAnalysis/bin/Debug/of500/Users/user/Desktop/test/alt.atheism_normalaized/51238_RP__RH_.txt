But you havent taken into the account of propoganda  Remember if you 
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered they would 
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at

You see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general

Well they havent managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity

people that wanted to have an abortion  They could create similar problems 
for us  And it could be worse  They can try to stop abortions by blocking 
clinics etc but imagine what theyd have to do to stop atheism

So you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a 
whole room of them
