This frayed thread has turned into a patented altatheism 5on1 
pingpong game and I dont have any strong disagreement so Ill try 
to stick to the one thing I dont quite follow about the argument 
 
It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible 
was enlightened for its times ie closer to what we would consider 
morally good based on our standards and past experience on the one 
hand I hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on the 
other hand

But if thats how the Bible is actually being used today 
shouldnt that be how we should judge it  If most people 
use scissors to cut paper shouldnt Consumers Reports 
test scissors for papercutting ability even though 
scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth 
 
Thats possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching 
Jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this 
highlyinterpreted version is what was enlightened for its times 
To attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that the 
original scissormakers were unusually advanced at papercutting for 
their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even 
heard of paper 
 
Im not arguing that the Bible is disgusting though some of the 
history depicted in it is by modern standards  However history is 
full of similar abuses and I dont think the Biblical accounts are 
worse than their contemporariesor possibly ours  On the other hand 
I dont know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible 
shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries or ours  That complex 
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic 
interpretations of that history is interesting but I still dont 
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it 
to attack condemnation of the original history
