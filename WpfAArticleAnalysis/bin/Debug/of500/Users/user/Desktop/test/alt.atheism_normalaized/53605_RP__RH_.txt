Why shouldnt I mind It sounds as if you are proceeding with just 
the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of I always preceeded 
my statements with it is my understanding that Now I have made 
my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and  
with Khomeinis supposed claim of infalibility After hearing your 
seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim 
regarding himself I have withdrawn that portion of my statement 
regarding that claim However I have received no such response 
regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams There is nothing 
obfuscationist about my claims which are always made clearly 
  
I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams 
but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  
other such opaque concepts often used by people to camoflage the  
baselessness of their positions particularly in matters of theology 
These are just the sorts of concepts used by Christian churches 
the perverting of their religion
