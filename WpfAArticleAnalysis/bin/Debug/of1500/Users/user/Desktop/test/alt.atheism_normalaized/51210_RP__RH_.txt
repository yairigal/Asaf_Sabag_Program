Of course BM is not incorrect  He is defending Islam  When defending 
Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize 
you  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm  So 
BM can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the 
temporary atheists can later say that they were always good Muslims because 
they never explicitly rejected Islam   
 
Temporary atheism temporary Islam temporary marriage  None of it sticks   
A teflon religion  How convenient  And so easy to clean up after  But  
then what would you expect from a bunch of people who cant even agree on  
the phases of the moon
