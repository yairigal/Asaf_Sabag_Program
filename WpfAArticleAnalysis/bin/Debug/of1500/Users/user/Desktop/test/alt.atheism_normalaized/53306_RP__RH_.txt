	We only need to ask the question what did the founding fathers  
consider cruel and unusual punishment 
 
	Hanging Hanging there slowing being strangled would be very  
painful both physically and psychologicall I imagine 
 
	Firing squad   note not a clean way to die back in those  
days  etc  
 
	All would be considered cruel under your definition 
	All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers 
 
  
 
         Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken  
 
        John Laws a man without the honor to keep his given word
