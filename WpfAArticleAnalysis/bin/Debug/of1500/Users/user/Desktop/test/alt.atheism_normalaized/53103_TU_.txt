THE ONLINE WEBSTER GETS IN SOME GOOD LICKS, TOO:

	1B1: EXISTING ONLY IN RELATION TO A KNOWING SUBJECT OR WILLING AGENT

	1B3: BELONGING TO THE SENSIBLE WORLD AND BEING INTERSUBJECTIVELY 
	     OBSERVABLE OR VERIFIABLE ESP. BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF A 
	     SYMPTOM OF DISEASE

	1B4: PERCEPTIBLE TO PERSONS OTHER THAN AN AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL

FOR REASON I CAN'T QUITE PIN DOWN, I PARTICULARLY LIKED 1B4.

JON.
