No the argument says John has known Q ie a codified version of the logia 
and not the original assuming that there has been one It has weaknesses 
of course like that John might have known the original yet rather referred 
to Q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in 
the first place 
  
The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into 
the dating usually given for the gospels

Not necessarily Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the 
version given by Matthew Improving on Matthew would give a motive for 
instance 
  
As far as I know the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a 
statistical analysis of the texts

Yep but it will take another day or so to get the source I hope your German 
is good enough
