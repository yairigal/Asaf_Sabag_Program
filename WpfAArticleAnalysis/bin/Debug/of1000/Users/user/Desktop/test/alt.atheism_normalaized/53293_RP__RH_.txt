|Theism is correlated with fanaticism I have neither said that all fanatism 
|is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism The point is 
|theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic One could of course 
|argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just 
|have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology 
|to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it 
 
IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your  
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered  Gullibility  
blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more  
reliable indicators  And the really dangerous people  the sources of 
fanaticism  are often none of these things  They are cynical manipulators 
of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing  Now *some* 
brands of theism and more precisely *some* theists do tend to fanaticism 
I grant you  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned 
argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction 
of religious freedom  Ever read Animal Farm

|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason The latter has 
|been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate One point is that 
|the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does 
|not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information 
 
Well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful 
based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would 
be irrational  Which is it 
 
The first part of the second statement contains no information because 
you dont say what the beliefs are  If the beliefs are strong theism  
andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  The 
second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an 
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is 
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is 
used to obtain it 
 
|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of 
|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational 
 
I cant agree with this until you are specific  *which* theism  To 
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which 
I suspect you do not have 
 
|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen It has to be true because I believe 
|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis However the beliefs say they are 
|more than a work hypothesis 
 
I dont understand this  Can you formalise your argument
