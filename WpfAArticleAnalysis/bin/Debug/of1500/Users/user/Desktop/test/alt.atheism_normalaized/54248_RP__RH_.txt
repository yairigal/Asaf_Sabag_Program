   Precisely my position   
 
   As a newbie I tried the pointbypoint approach to debate with 
   these types  It wasted both my time and my lifespan  Ignoring 
   them is not an option since they dont go away and doing so 
   would leave one with large stretches of complete anonymity in this 
   group

Ive posted here long enough to see your name a few times but I 
cant recall any point by point approach to anything youve 
contributed But Im old probably senile and I may have just 
forgotten if you could post an example of your invincible logic it 
might jog my memory
