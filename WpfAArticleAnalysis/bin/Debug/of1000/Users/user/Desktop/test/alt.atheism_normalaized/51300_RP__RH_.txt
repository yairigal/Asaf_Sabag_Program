I see it is not rational but it is intellectual Does madness qualify 
as intellectual engagement too

Exactly why science uses mathematics QM representation in natural language 
is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical 
terminology Nor is it supposed to be the truth as opposed to the 
representation of gods or religions in ordinary language Admittedly 
not  every religion says so but a fancy side effect of their inept 
representations are the eternal hassles between religions 
  
And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will 
be agreed upon as being similar Show me something similar in religion

With the effect that the models presented are useless And one can argue 
that the other way around namely that the only reason metaphysics still 
flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified  
showing that it is bogus

Havent you read the many posts about what reliability is and how it can 
be acheived respectively determined
