Ive said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you 
might have caught on by now  And there is no alternative but the point 
is rationality isnt an alternative either  The problems of metaphysical 
and religious knowledge are unsolvable or I should say humans cannot 
solve them 
 
If there is truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever 
for your claim  The usual line here which you call a prejudgment of 
atheism and dispute is that reason is all we have  Here you admit 
that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that 
there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in 
religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts with 
religious knowledge 
 
This sounds very much like I cant provide a rational defense for my 
belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it 
may be false  I hope it makes you happy but your repeated and 
unfounded assertions to this effect dont advance your cause
