This is a standard argument for fundies  Can you spot the falicy The 
statement is arguing from the assumption that Jesus actually existed  So far 
they have not been able to offer real proof of that existance  Most of them 
try it using the very flawed writings of Josh McDowell and others to prove 
it but those writers use VERY flawed sources  If they are real sources at 
all some are not  When will they ever learn to do real research instead of 
believing the drivel sold in the Christian bookstores
