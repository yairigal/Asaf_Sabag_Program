 This deserves framing  It really does  Atoms arent even real 
 
 Tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are 
 atoms now so what are they  Figments of our imaginations  The 
 evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but I wont bother with 
 most evidence at the moment 
 
You would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are 
actaully there  as perceived This may be interesting I thought 
that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of light 
can illuminate any object of atomic scale If this image is to have 
useful resolution wouldnt the illuminating sources wavelength have 
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed 
 
If an atom is a probablity cloud lower resolutions would give the 
appearance of solidity but it seems fairly certain that an atom is 
not an object is any conventional sense Obviously I am not a 
physicist but the question does have ramification of a philosophic 
nature Anyway just a stray thought carry on
