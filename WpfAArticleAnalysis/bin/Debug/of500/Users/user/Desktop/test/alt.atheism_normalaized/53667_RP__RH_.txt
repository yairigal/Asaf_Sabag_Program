Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism 
The point is that theism is *a* factor 
 
Thats your claim now back it up  I consider your argument as useful 
as the following  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  Therefore 
belief is *a* factor in fanaticism  True and utterly useless  Note this 
is *any* belief not belief in Gods

Thats a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the 
field of theism the leaders believe what they say 
 
If you believe that youre incredibly naive

Thats a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is 
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism 
 
No some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common 
with *some* fanaticism    Your last statement simply isnt implied by 
what you say before because youre trying to sneak in innate features 
of all theism  The word youre groping for is some 
 
Gullibility by the way is one of them 
 
No shit Sherlock  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism
