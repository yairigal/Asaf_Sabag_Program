No wonder that we dont see any detail for this claim It is good to 
remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist 
by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination 
It is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer Not unlike the 
rest of your arguments

I am extremely wary of the way you use words Like in this case there 
are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by 
themselves and others theists I have pointed to that in my post You 
use one of them 
  
Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption because my 
moral is objectiveabsolute or the other buzz words you are so fond 
of everybody will know it and there is no need to define it more 
exactly 
  
And as a user has shown recently the easiest way to dispell you is 
to ask you for definitions

Since you are the only one seeing them and many correspondents 
point to the flaws in your reasoning respectively discussing I 
cant say I am impressed
