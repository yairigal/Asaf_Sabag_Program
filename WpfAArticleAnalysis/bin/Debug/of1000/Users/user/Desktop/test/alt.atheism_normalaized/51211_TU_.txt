THIS KIND OF ARGUMENT CRIES FOR A COMMENT...

JBROWN@BATMAN.BMD.TRW.COM WROTE:
: IN ARTICLE <1993APR3.095220.24632@LELAND.STANFORD.EDU>, GALAHAD@LELAND.STANFORD.EDU (SCOTT COMPTON) WRITES:

JIM, YOU ORIGINALLY WROTE:
 
: >>...GOD DID NOT CREATE
: >>DISEASE NOR IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MALADIES OF NEWBORNS.
: > 
: >>WHAT GOD DID CREATE WAS LIFE ACCORDING TO A PROTEIN CODE WHICH IS
: >>MUTABLE AND CAN EVOLVE.  WITHOUT DELVING INTO A DEEP DISCUSSION OF
: >>CREATIONISM VS EVOLUTIONISM, GOD CREATED THE ORIGINAL GENETIC CODE
: >>PERFECT AND WITHOUT FLAW. 
: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~

DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THIS? IF THE CODE WAS ONCE PERFECT, AND
HAS DEGRADED EVER SINCE, WE _SHOULD_ HAVE SOME EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR
OF THIS STATEMENT, SHOULDN'T WE?

PERHAPS THE BIGGEST "IMPERFECTION" OF THE CODE IS THAT IT IS FULL
OF NON-CODING REGIONS, INTRONS, WHICH ARE SO CALLED BECAUSE THEY
INTERVENE WITH THE CODING REGIONS (EXONS). AN IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INTRONS ARE OF VERY ANCIENT ORIGIN; IT IS
LIKELY THAT EARLY EXONS REPRESENTED EARLY PROTEIN DOMAINS.

IS THE NUMBER OF INTRONS DECREASING OR INCREASING? IT APPEARS THAT
INTRON LOSS CAN OCCUR, AND SPECIES WITH COMMON ANCESTRY USUALLY
HAVE QUITE SIMILAR EXON-INTRON STRUCTURE IN THEIR GENES. 

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POSSIBILITY THAT INTRONS HAVE BEEN INSERTED
LATER, PRESENTS SEVERAL LOGICAL DIFFICULTIES. INTRONS ARE REMOVED
BY A SPLICING MECHANISM - THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE PRESENT, BUT UNUSED,
IF INTRONS ARE INSERTED. MOREOVER, INTRON INSERTION WOULD HAVE
REQUIRED _PRECISE_ TARGETING - RANDOM INSERTION WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED,
SINCE SEQUENCES FOR INTRON REMOVAL (SELF-SPLICING OF MRNA) ARE
CONSERVED. BESIDES, TRANSPOSITION OF A SEQUENCE USUALLY LEAVES A
TRACE - LONG TERMINAL REPEATS AND TARGET - SITE DUPLICATIONS, AND
THESE ARE NOT FOUND IN OR NEAR INTRON SEQUENCES. 

I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND READING TEXTBOOKS ON MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND
GENETICS BEFORE POSTING "THEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS" LIKE THIS. 
TRY WATSON'S MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE GENE OR DARNELL, LODISH
& BALTIMORE'S MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL FOR STARTERS.

: REMEMBER, THE QUESTION WAS POSED IN A THEOLOGICAL CONTEXT (WHY DOES
: GOD CAUSE DISEASE IN NEWBORNS?), AND MY ANSWER IS LIKEWISE FROM A
: THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE -- MY OWN.  IT IS NO LESS VALID THAN A PURELY
: SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE, JUST DIFFERENT.

SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE IS SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE, WHEREAS 
THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES OFTEN FAIL TO FULFIL THIS CRITERION.
 
: I THINK YOU MISREAD MY MEANING.  I SAID GOD MADE THE GENETIC CODE PERFECT,
: BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECT NOW.  IT HAS CERTAINLY EVOLVED SINCE.

FOR THE WORSE? WOULD YOU PLEASE CITE A FEW REFERENCES THAT SUPPORT
YOUR ASSERTION? YOUR ASSERTION IS LESS VALID THAN THE SCIENTIFIC
PERSPECTIVE, UNLESS YOU SUPPORT IT BY SOME EVIDENCE.

IN FACT, IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT PARASITES AND DISEASES ARE PERHAPS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WE'VE THOUGHT - FOR INSTANCE, SEX MIGHT
HAVE EVOLVED AS DEFENCE AGAINST PARASITES. (THIS VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY
COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF EVOLUTION, EG TIERRA.) 
 
: PERHAPS.  I THOUGHT IT WAS HIGHER ENERGY RAYS LIKE X-RAYS, GAMMA
: RAYS, AND COSMIC RAYS THAT CAUSED MOST OF THE DAMAGE.

IN FACT, IT IS THERMAL ENERGY THAT DOES MOST OF THE DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH
IT IS USUALLY MILD AND EASILY FIXED BY ENZYMATIC ACTION. 

: ACTUALLY, NEITHER OF US "KNOWS" WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS LIKE AT THE
: TIME WHEN GOD CREATED LIFE.  ACCORDING TO MY RECOLLECTION, MOST
: BIOLOGISTS DO NOT CLAIM THAT LIFE BEGAN 4 BILLION YEARS AGO -- AFTER
: ALL, THAT WOULD ONLY BE A HALF BILLION YEARS OR SO AFTER THE EARTH
: WAS CREATED.  IT WOULD STILL BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO SUPPORT LIFE.  I
: SEEM TO REMEMBER A FIGURE MORE LIKE 2.5 TO 3 BILLION YEARS AGO FOR
: THE ORIGINATION OF LIFE ON EARTH.  ANYONE WITH A BETTER ESTIMATE?

I'D REPLACE "CREATED" WITH "FORMED", SINCE THERE IS NO NEED TO 
INVOKE ANY CREATOR IF THE EARTH CAN BE FORMED WITHOUT ONE.
MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF THE AGE OF THE EARTH RANGE BETWEEN 4.6 - 4.8
BILLION YEARS, AND EARLIEST SIGNS OF LIFE (NOT TRUE FOSSILS, BUT
ORGANIC, STROMATOLITE-LIKE LAYERS) DATE BACK TO 3.5 BILLION YEARS.
THIS WOULD LEAVE MORE THAN BILLION YEARS FOR THE FIRST CELLS TO
EVOLVE.

I'M SORRY I CAN'T GIVE ANY REFERENCES, THIS IS BASED ON THE COURSE
ON EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY I ATTENDED HERE. 

: >>DOMINION, IT WAS NO GREAT FEAT FOR SATAN TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER
: >>DISEASES, BOTH BACTERIAL/VIRAL AND GENETIC.  ALTHOUGH THE FORCES OF
: >>NATURAL SELECTION TEND TO IMPROVE THE SURVIVABILITY OF SPECIES, THE
: >>DEGENERATION OF THE GENETIC CODE TENDS TO MORE THAN OFFSET THIS.  

AGAIN, DO YOU _WANT_ THIS BE TRUE, OR DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR
THIS SUPPOSED "DEGENERATION"? 

I CAN UNDERSTAND SCOTT'S REACTION:

: > EXCUSE ME, BUT THIS IS SO FAR-FETCHED THAT I KNOW YOU MUST BE
: > JESTING.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT PATHOGENS ARE?  DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
: > POINT MUTATIONS ARE?  DO YOU KNOW THAT EVERYTHING CAN COME
: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  
: 
: IN RESPONSE TO YOUR LAST STATEMENT, NO, AND NEITHER DO YOU.
: YOU MAY VERY WELL BELIEVE THAT AND ACCEPT IT AS FACT, BUT YOU
: CANNOT *KNOW* THAT.

I HOPE YOU DON'T FORGET THIS: WE HAVE _EVIDENCE_ THAT SUGGESTS 
EVERYTHING CAN COME ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY. DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST
THIS CONCLUSION? IN SCIENCE, ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO _BELIEVE_ IN 
ANYTHING. IT IS A HEALTHY SIGN TO DOUBT AND DISBELIEVE. BUT THE 
RIGHT PATH TO WALK IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE IF YOU DO SO,
AND NOT TO PRESENT ONE'S OWN CONCLUSIONS PRIOR TO THIS. 

THEOLOGY DOES NOT USE THIS METHOD. THEREFORE, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
IT COULD EVER COME TO RIGHT CONCLUSIONS.

: >>HUMAN DNA, BEING MORE "COMPLEX", TENDS TO ACCUMULATE ERRORS ADVERSELY
: >>AFFECTING OUR WELL-BEING AND ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF DISEASE, WHILE THE 
: >>SIMPLER DNA OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES TEND TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN 
: >>CAUSING INFECTION AND DISEASE.  IT IS A BAD COMBINATION.  HENCE
: >>WE HAVE NEWBORNS THAT SUFFER FROM GENETIC, VIRAL, AND BACTERIAL
: >>DISEASES/DISORDERS.

YOU ARE SUPPOSING A PURPOSE, NOT A VALID MOVE. BACTERIA AND VIRUSES
DO NOT EXIST TO CAUSE DISEASE. THEY ARE JUST ANOTHER MANIFESTS OF
A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF EVOLUTION - ONLY REPLICATION SAVES REPLICATORS
FROM DEGRADIATION.
