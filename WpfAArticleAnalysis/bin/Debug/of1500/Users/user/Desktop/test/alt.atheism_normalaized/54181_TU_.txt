(ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE 'OBJECTIVE MORALITY'):

> I'LL TAKE A WILD GUESS AND SAY FREEDOM IS OBJECTIVELY VALUABLE.  I BASE

      SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THAT "ALMOST" IN THERE, FREEDOM WILL BE A
MOSTLY VALUABLE THING, TO MOST PEOPLE. THAT IS, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY
SAYING, "A REAL BIG LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE FREEDOM IS SUBJECTIVELY VALUABLE
TO THEM". THAT'S GOOD, AND A QUITE NICE STARTING POINT FOR A MORAL
SYSTEM, BUT IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL, AND THUS NOT "OBJECTIVE".

> THEREFORE I TAKE IT THAT TO ASSERT OR
> BELIEVE THAT "FREEDOM IS NOT VERY VALUABLE", WHEN ALMOST EVERYONE CAN SEE
> THAT IT IS, IS EVERY BIT AS ABSURD AS TO ASSERT "IT IS NOT RAINING" ON
> A RAINY DAY.

      IT ISN'T IN SAHARA.
