Mathew I agree  This it seems is the crux of your whole position 
isnt it  That the US shouldnt have supported Hussein and sold him arms 
to fight Iran  I agree  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those 
who did or do  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein and its a done deal 
Now he invades Kuwait  So do we just sit back and say Well we sold 
him all those arms I suppose he just wants to use them now  Too bad 
for Kuwait  No unfortunately sitting back and letting things be 
is not the way to correct a former mistake  Destroying Husseins 
military potential as we did was the right move  But I agree with 
your statement Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to 
sell arms to Hussein  So its really not the Gulf War you abhor 
so much it was the USs and the Wests shortsightedness in selling 
arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right 
 
If so then I agree
