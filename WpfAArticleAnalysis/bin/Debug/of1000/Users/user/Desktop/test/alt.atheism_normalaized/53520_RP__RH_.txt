Too bad youre starting off with a faulty translation Try this instead 
 
When God began to create heaven and earth  the earth being unformed 
and void with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God 
sweeping over the water  God said Let there be light and there was 
light God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from 
the darkness God called the light Day and the darkness He called 
Night And there was evening and there was morning a first day
