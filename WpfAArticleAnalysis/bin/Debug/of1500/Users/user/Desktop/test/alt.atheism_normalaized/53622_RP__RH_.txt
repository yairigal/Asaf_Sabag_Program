Tiring to say the least I have backed it up read the first statement 
 
I have read it  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point 
 
  
The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy Saying someone believes 
something is hardly an information about the person at all Saying someone 
is a theist holds much more information Further the correlation between 
theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism 
because of the special features of theistic belief 
 
Truth by blatant assertion  Evidence

You Frank ODwyer are living in a dream world I wonder if there is any 
base of discussion left after such a statement As a matter of fact I think 
you are ignorant of human nature Even when one starts with something one does 
not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says 
  
To give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement 
 
The onus of proof is on you sunshine  What makes you think that 
theist leaders believe what they say  Especially when they say 
one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its 
opposite  The practice is not restricted to theism but its there 
for anyone to see  Its almost an epidemic in this country 
 
Just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye 
of a needle why is the Catholic church such a wealthy landowner  Why 
are there churches to the square inch in my country

Bogus again Not all theism as is is fanatic However the rest already 
gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and 
theism And further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them 
to switch to fanatism easily It takes just a nifty improvement in the 
theology 
 
Truth by blatant assertion

Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people 
causing the correlation And the whole discussion started that way by the 
statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you 
challenged 
 
Indeed I did  As I recall I asked for evidence  What is the correlation 
of which you speak

Blah blah blah I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights 
protects me better from fanatics than the other way round 
 
Of course other people are always fanatics never oneself  Your 
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me 
  
It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between 
that argument and the rise of fanatism So far it is just another of your 
assertions 
 
So  You can do it

Another of your assertions No proof no evidence just claims

That is unusually weak even for you The latter implies that my proof 
depends on their opinion Somehow who does not accept that there are 
triangles wont accept Pythagoras Wow thats an incredible insight 
I dont have to prove them wrong in their opinion It is possible to 
show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims 
unreliable or even absurd statements to be information 
 
Totally circular and totally useless 
  
Their wish to believe makes them believe Things are judges by their appeal 
and not by their information It makes you feel good when you believe that 
may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls From 
belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt 
 
Truth by blatant assertion  Ive seen as many bogus proofs of the  
nonexistence of gods as I have of their existence 
 
  
Rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from 
logical analysis the point is that the
