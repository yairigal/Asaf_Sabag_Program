As much as I considered some of the socalled Islamrelated dialogue 
here a total waste of time I somehow cant restrain myself in this 
instance so Gregg try this 
 
2052 PST  I come to my senses and accept the allknowing 
wisdom and power of the Quran and Allah  Not only that but Allah  
himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice Allah rolls a 
few bones and we get down  Then Allah gets out the Crisco bends  
over and invites me to take a spin around the block  Wow 
 
2056 PST  I realize that maybe Allah is looking for more of a  
commitment than Im ready for so I say Man Ive got some 
programming to do  Gotta go  Ill call you 
 
2059 PST   Thinking it over I renounce Islam 
 
BTW Gregg Allah said he still thinks of you
