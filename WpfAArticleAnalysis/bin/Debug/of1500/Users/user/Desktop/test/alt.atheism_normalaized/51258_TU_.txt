>THE POINT HAS BEEN RAISED AND HAS BEEN ANSWERED.  ROGER AND I HAVE
>CLEARLY STATED OUR SUPPORT OF THE BSA POSITION ON THE ISSUE;
>SPECIFICALLY, THAT HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF
>THE SCOUT OATH (SPECIFICALLY, THE PROMISE TO LIVE "MORALLY STRAIGHT").

	PLEASE DEFINE "MORALLY STRAIGHT". 

	
	
	AND, DON'T EVEN TRY SAYING THAT "STRAIGHT", AS IT IS USED HERE, 
IMPLIES ONLY HETERSEXUAL BEHAVIOR. [ EG: "STRAIGHT" AS IN THE SLANG WORD 
OPPOSITE TO "GAY" ]


	THIS IS ALOT LIKE "FAMILY VALUES". EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THEM, 
BUT MISTERIOUSLY, NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE.
