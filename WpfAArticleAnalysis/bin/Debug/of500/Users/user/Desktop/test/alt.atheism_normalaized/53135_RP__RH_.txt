I am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded 
respect for people who have been on newsgroupsmailing lists longer than I 
have so you certainly have my sympathy Tom  I have only been semiregularly 
posting it is TOUGHto keep up since this February but I have been reading 
and following the threads since last August my schools newsreader was down 
for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new 
feed site so it wasnt accepting outgoing postings  I dont think anyone 
keeps track of where other posters go its that old love em and leave em 
Internet for you again 
 
 
best regards
