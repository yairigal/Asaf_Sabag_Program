>[DELETED, TO GET TO THE POINT:]
>> 
>> THEREFORE, IN A NUTSHELL, MY OPINION IS THAT PRE-MARITAL SEX MAKES THE
>> LIKELIHOOD OF EXTRA-MARITAL SEX MORE PROBABLE.  FURTHERMORE,
>> IN MY OPINION, EXTRA-MARITAL SEX HELPS BREAK DOWN PARTNERSHIPS AND LEADS
>> TO GREATER DIVORCE RATES.  THIS IN TURN, IN MY OPINION, CREATES TRAUMA
>> AND A LESS STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN, WHO ARE THEN, IN MY OPINION,
>> MORE LIKELY TO GROW UP WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION,
>> ETC.  AND THUS, SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE IS, IN THE LONG RUN, HARMFUL TO
>> SOCIETY.

>I THINK THAT YOU ARE DRAWING LINKS WHERE THERE ARE NONE - HAVING SEX BEFORE
>MARRIAGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ADULTERY ONCE COMMITTED INTO MARRIAGE. THE
>ISSUE AS I SEE IT IS MORE OF HOW COMMITTED YOU ARE TO NOT FOISTING PAIN ON
>YOUR SPOUSE, AND HOW CONFIDENT YOU ARE ABOUT YOURSELF. 
>	IN ADDITION, WHAT SOMEONE DOES WITHIN THEIR MARRIAGE IS THEIR OWN 
>BUSINESS, NOT MINE, AND NOT YOURS. I HAVE WITNESSED STRONG RELATIONSHIPS
>THAT INCORPORATE EXTRA-MARITAL SEX. 
>	I WOULD AGREE WITH YOUR ASSERTION ABOUT CHILDREN - CHILDREN SHOULD NOT  BE WITNESS TO SUCH CONFUSING RELATIONSHIPS - IF ADULTERY IS STRESSFUL TO 
>ADULTS, WHICH I ASSUME IT IN GENERAL IS, HOW CAN WE EXPECT CHILDREN TO 
>UNDERSTAND IT?
>> 
>> WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE FOR MY OPINIONS?  AT THE MOMENT, THERE ARE JUST
>> GENERALITIES I CAN CITE.  FOR EXAMPLE, I READ THAT IN THE 20TH CENTURY,
>> THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH (AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL) WHO SUFFER FROM
>> DEPRESSION HAS BEEN STEADILY CLIMBING IN WESTERN SOCIETIES (PROBABLY
>> WHAT I WAS READING REFERRED PARTICULARLY TO THE USA).  SIMILARLY, ONE
>> CAN DETECT A TREND TOWARDS GREATER OCCURRENCE OF SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE
>> IN THIS CENTURY IN WESTERN SOCIETIES -- PARTICULARLY WITH THE "SEXUAL
>> REVOLUTION" OF THE 60'S, BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT I THINK (OTHERWISE THE
>> "SEXUAL REVOLUTION" OF THE 60'S WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE),
>> PARTICULARLY WITH THE GRADUAL WEAKENING OF CHRISTIANITY AND CONSEQUENTLY
>> CHRISTIAN MORAL TEACHINGS AGAINST SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE.  I PROPOSE
>> THAT THESE TWO TRENDS -- GREATER LEVEL OF GENERAL DEPRESSION IN SOCIETY
>> (AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS) AND GREATER SEXUAL PROMISCUITY -- ARE
>> LINKED, WITH THE LATTER BEING A PRIME CAUSE OF THE FORMER.  I CANNOT
>> PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE BEYOND THIS AT THIS STAGE, BUT THE WHOLE THESIS
>> SEEMS VERY REASONABLE TO ME AND I REQUEST THAT PEOPLE PONDER UPON IT.

>WHY IS IT MORE REASONABLE THAN THE TREND TOWARDS OBESITY AND THE TREND TOWARDS
>DEPRESSION? YOU CAN'T JUST PICK YOUR TWO FAVORITE TRENDS, NOTICE A CORRELATION 
>IN THEM, AND MAKE A SWEEPING STATEMENT OF GENERALITY. I MEAN, YOU CAN, AND 
>PEOPLE HAVE, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS A VALID OR REASONABLE THESIS. 
>AT BEST IT'S A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF THE PUSH-PULL FACTORS PEOPLE 
>EXPERIENCE.
