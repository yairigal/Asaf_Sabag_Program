I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia  Now how is it such a grave 
mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons  Or are you claiming that we shouldnt 
sell any weapons to other countries  Straightforward answer please

Who benefits from arms sales  Hint it isnt normally the govt  It is 
the contractor that builds that piece of equipment  Believe it or not 
the US and UK dont export the huge quantities of arms that you have 
just accused them of doing  Arms exports are rare enough that it 
requires an act of congress for nonsmall arms to most countries if 
not all  Do you believe in telling everyone who can do what and who 
can sell their goods to whom
