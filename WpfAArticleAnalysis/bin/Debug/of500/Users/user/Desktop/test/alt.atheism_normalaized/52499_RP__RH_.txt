abstract is that it creates information from no information  This is 
considered invalid in information theory  Statement 1 indicates one has no 
information about God  but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information 
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God  This violates 
information entropy  information has been extracted from no information at 
no cost 
 
The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions  The 
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the 
Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption The 
argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests 
to believe in God  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal 
intended the argument to be viewed 
 
The biggest reason why Pascals wager is a failure is that if God is 
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as 
a wager  He will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all 
whether people believe in him 
 
 
 
Subject What is Occams Razor 
 
Typical posting 
 
People keep talking about Occams Razor  What is it 
 
Response 
 
William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occams  
Razor  In its original form it said Do not multiply entities  
unnecessarily  That is if you can explain something without supposing 
the existence of some entity then do so 
 
Nowadays when people refer to Occams Razor they generally express it  
more generally for example as Take the simplest solution 
 
The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  
for what we see around us 
 
1 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which 
came into being as a result of natural processes 
 
2 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and  
there is also a God who created the universe  Clearly this God must be  
of nonzero complexity 
 
Given that both explanations fit the facts Occams Razor might suggest  
that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one 
Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution 
 
3 There isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there   
We just imagine that there is 
 
This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people  
find unacceptable
