True  At first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos 
the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from 
the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets  But later and especially 
after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone  It 
seemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war 
that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare  Its like 
they were only proGulfWar as long as it was nice and clean smart 
missiles dropping in on military HQs but not when pictures of dead 
dying and maimed civilians started cropping up  What naive hypocrites

I should have said here militarily justified  It seems from your 
comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified 
I apologize

I have often wondered about this  Ive always thought that the first bomb 
should have been dropped on Japans island fortress of Truk  A good 
inpenatrable military target  The second bomb couldve been held back 
for use on an industrial center if need be  But I digress 
 
Yes I have heard that we found evidence after the war BTW that Japan 
was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb  Unfortunately 
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the USs 
ulimatum  Therefore the second bomb was dropped  Most unfortunate IMO

I dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made 
which affect the lives of innocent people  But I do regret the  
circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the 
suffering caused by those decisions

Actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US 
and allied action  If some backwater country took over some other 
backwater country we probably wouldnt intervene  Not that we dont 
care but we cant be the worlds policman  Or if a coup had occured 
in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have acted 
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to 
Saudi Arabia  But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion 
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the Wests oil  
interests caused us to take action

Im not setting up a strawman at all  If you want to argue against the 
war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep 
Kuwait  Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective
