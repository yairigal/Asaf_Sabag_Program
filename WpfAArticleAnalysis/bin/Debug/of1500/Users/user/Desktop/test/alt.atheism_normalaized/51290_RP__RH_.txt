 Crap crap crap crap crap  A definition of any type of phobe comes from 
 phobia = an irrational fear of  Hence a homophobe not only in ACT UP meetings 
 the word is apparently in general use now  Or perhaps it isnt in the bible   
 Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak 
  
 Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider  Does an 
 agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space  Do you 
 understand English 
  
 Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it  They will do their best 
 to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or 
 run away  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes  People 
 who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or 
 cause them or themselves violence 
  
 
Isnt that what I said  
What are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely 
parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful

 So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children 
 Hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated  Obviously you keep to the 
 Monty Python song  Every sperm is sacred  And if as *you* say it has 
 a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own  
 arguement natural 
 
Consider the context Im talking about an evolutionary function One 
of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a 
species procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context

 Well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have  
 vanished *years* ago due to nonprocreation  Also the parent from single 
 parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must 
 by your arguement die 
 
By your argument homosexuality is genetically determined As to your 
second point you prove again that you have no idea what context 
means I am talking about evolution the preservation of the species 
the fundamental premise of the whole process

 Read the above  I expect you to have at least ten children by now with 
 the family growing  These days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly 
 without it there would be noone but more to do with pleasure  In prepill 
 and precondom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children 
 These days is just aint true  People can decide whether or not to have  
 children and when  Soon they will be able to choose its sex c but thats  
 another arguement so its more of a lifestyle decision  Again by 
 your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must 
 be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children  Both are  
 as unnatural as each other 
 
Yet another nonsequitur Sex is an evolutionary function that exists 
for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental That 
homosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation and 
nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose

 People are people are people  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live 
 their life  Are you godtm  If so fancy a date 
 
Heres pretty obvious dodge do you really think youve said anything 
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement I am not 
telling anyone anything I am demonstrating that there are arguments 
against the practice of homosexuality providing its a merely an 
alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably 
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand I realize 
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value 
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you 
are to be consistent you have no case in this regard

 Again crap  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals  Likewise the 
 bible  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by 
 a bastard to eternal damnation  Or someone who crushes his penis either 
 accidently or not  Both are in Deuteronomy 
 
Im sure your comment pertains to something but youve disguised it 
so well I cant see what Where did I mention ideals outdated or 
otherwise Your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything 
at all to contribute

 You show me *anyone* who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as 
 normal
