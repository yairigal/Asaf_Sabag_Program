      Aha this would put the definition much closer to the moral 
absolutism Im more aquainted to debating

      We all agree that its rather unlikely as the definitions of 
rape and murder are tied to the definitions of evil more like 
impossible actually but what if some society someday actually hit 
on a good sound reason for why rape and murder should be moral

      I dont quite parse this but you seem to be saying absolute 
morals are defensible insofar as we consider them good Which of 
course is correct but then you need an absolute definition of good 
 
> Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry

      Hang on  whats an aberrance in a moral system 
Do you mean moral codes that seem useless or bad perchance But your 
judgement of what exactly is useless andor bad is your own opinion 
subjective not objective 
 
>  if specific actions are given 
> moral status I tend to question those morals
