Well heres how I prepared  I got one of those big beach 
umbrellas some of those gelpack ice things a big Coleman cooler 
which Ive loaded up with Miller Draft so I like Miller Draft 
so sue me a new pair of New Balance sneakers a Sony 
Watchman and a couple of cartons of BonTon Cheddar Cheese 
Popcorn 
 
I havent decided what to wear yet  What does one wear to an 
eternal damnation
