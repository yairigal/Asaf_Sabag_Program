I believe that morality is subjective  Each person is entitled to his 
own moral attitudes  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone 
elses  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the 
basis of his rather than my moral standards  While he is entitled to 
believe what his own moral sense tells him the rest of society is 
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is 
offensive to the majority 
 
Why  Your last statement  Why  By which authority   
 
Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral  The may realize that 
it is immoral and not care  They are thus not following their own moral 
system but being immoral  For someone to lay claim to an alternative 
moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be 
internally consistent   
 
Why  Your last statement  Why are these things necessary   
 
And believe me a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly 
consistent 
 
Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and 
thus may be incapable of behaving morally  While someone like Hitler 
may have believed that his actions were moral we may judge him immoral 
by our standards  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean 
that we must excuse the murderer 
 
Trouble is this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler too 
I do *not* mean any comparison or offence David   Try substituting  
the social minority of your choice for sociopath Hitler  and 
murderer  No logical difference  Someone like you vs someone like 
Hitler Zero sum
