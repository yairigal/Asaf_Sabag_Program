Get thee to a natural history museum or a library Mr Rawlins  How 
do you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines and 
other primal hominids like Homo erectus  Homo erectus was 
certainly not an ape and it definitely was not a modern human either 
Consider some of its morphological features small cranial capacity 
supraorbital ridges receding forehead sharp angling of the occipital 
bone receding chin large masseter muscles for chewing pentagonal 
skull shape diastema between incisors and canines protruding 
canines shovelshaped incisors  H erectus was bipedal though 
So are these nearly complete skeletons of erectus human  Or ape 
Or fanciful reconstructions  Have you even seen one
