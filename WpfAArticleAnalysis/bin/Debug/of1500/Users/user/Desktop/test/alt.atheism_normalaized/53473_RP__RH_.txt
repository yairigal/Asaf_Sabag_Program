I cant It seems Jesus used logic to make people using logic 
look like fools No that does not sound right he maybe just 
told they were fools and thats it and people believed that 
Hmm does not sound reasonable either 
 
I find it always very intriguing to see people stating that 
transcendental values cant be explained and then in the 
next sentence they try to explain these unexplained values 
Highly strange
