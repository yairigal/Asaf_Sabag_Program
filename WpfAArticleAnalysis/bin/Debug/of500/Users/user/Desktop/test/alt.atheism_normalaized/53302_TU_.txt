AD HOMINEM, SARCASTIC INNUENDO?  ABSOLUTELY.  FORGOTTEN?  HARDLY.
BORED?  NOT REALLY.   I TRY NOT TO CONFUSE "LIFE ON A.A." WITH LIFE.

I JUST CAN'T OVERCOME THE URGE TO TEASE/TAUNT FOLKS WHO BOUND FAQ-LESS
ONTO A.A. WITH SUCH A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER.  TO LISTEN TO YOU,
ONE MIGHT THINK WE BELONGED TO SOME CHURCH!

I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF OTHERS WHO QUESTIONED YOUR POSTING
ON A LINE-BY-LINE CONTENT BASIS, THOUGH IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT
IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD, AS COMPARED TO, SAY, "SHOVELLING".

I THINK I ONLY LAMENTED THAT, WHATEVER THE INITIAL SATISFACTIONS,
PAST A CERTAIN POINT CIRCULAR ABUSE-HEAPING WAS JUST THAT.
