BILL CONNER (BIL@OKCFORUM.OSRHE.EDU) WROTE:
 
: THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT YOUR POST AND OTHERS IN THIS THREAD
: THAT ARE A LITTLE CONFUSING. AN ATHEIST IS ONE FOR WHOM ALL THINGS CAN
: BE UNDERSTOOD AS PROCESSES OF NATURE - EXCLUSIVELY.

THIS DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL ATHEISTS (SEE THE FAQ). HOWEVER,
I (FOR ONE) DO THINK THERE IS NO NEED TO INVOKE ANY DIVINE OR
SPIRITUAL EXPLANATIONS. 

IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TO CLAIM THAT ALL THINGS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD
AS NATURAL PROCESSES, AND TO CLAIM THAT OUR OBSERVATIONS DO NOT
REQUIRE US TO POSTULATE ANY DIVINE INTERVENTION, OR ANYTHING SPIRITUAL,
FOR THAT MATTER. HUMANS ARE NOT OMNIPOTENT, AND NEITHER IS SCIENCE.
HOWEVER, SCIENCE HAS ONE ADVANTAGE THEOLOGY DOESN'T: IT IS SELF-
CORRECTING, WITH NATURE AS ITS JUDGE. 

IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE HOW SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY IS REVEALING A SELF-
CONSISTENT, SIMPLE PICTURE OF OUR UNIVERSE. SCIENCE IS NO LONGER
A BUNCH OF SEPARATE BRANCHES, IT IS ONE. FROM PARTICLE PHYSICS TO
PSYCHOLOGY. AND NO ASPECT OF OUR LIFE, OR OUR UNIVERSE, IS SAFE
FROM ITS STERN AND STONY EYE. NOT EVEN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.

 THERE IS NO NEED
: FOR ANY RECOURSE TO DIVNITY TO DESCRIBE OR EXPLAIN ANYTHING. THERE IS
: NO PURPOSE OR DIRECTION FOR ANY EVENT BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY
: PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, ETC.; EVERYTHING IS RANDOM, NOTHING IS
: DETERMNINED.

ACTUALLY, DETERMINISM VS. INDETERMINISM IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION,
AND SCIENCE CANNOT SAY WHETHER THE WHOLE THING IS ACTUALLY SOMEHOW
SUPERDETERMINISTIC OR NOT. I THINK THE QUESTION DOES NOT HAVE
ANY MEANING, AS FAR AS INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS GO. IF THEIR APPARENT
FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SO FROM THEIR
PERSPECTIVE. BILL, CAN YOU SAY _FOR SURE_ WHETHER YOU HAVE A FREE
WILL OR NOT? 

: THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE OF COURSE AND ALL
: ITS PRODUCTS. THERE IS NOTHING REQUIRING THAT LIFE EVOLVE OR THAT IT
: ACQUIRE INTELLIGENCE, IT'S JUST A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

MAYBE. WHO ARE WE TO TELL? IT SEEMS INTELLIGENCE IS USEFUL - WHEN
DURING THE HISTORY OF EARTH HAS _ONE SPECIES_ BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL
ONE THIRD OF THE WHOLE BIOSPHERE? THIS CAN STILL BE A RESULT OF 
NUMEROUS HAPPY ACCIDENTS OUR GENETIC MACHINERY BLINDLY REPLICATES
AND PRESERVES. EVEN THAT MACHINERY CAN BE RESULT OF THE SAME
PRINCIPLE - ONLY THE SYSTEMS THAT CAN START REPLICATING WILL
SURVIVE, THOSE WHICH DON'T DON'T MAKE IT. (RECOMMENDED READING: T.O)

: FOR AN ATHEIST, NO
: EVENT CAN BE PREFERRED TO ANOTHER OR BE SAID TO HAVE MORE OR LESS
: VALUE THAN ANOTHER IN ANY NATURALISTIC SENSE, AND NO THOUGHT -ABOUT-
: AN EVENT CAN HAVE VALUE. 

FROM WHOSE PERSPECTIVE? I VALUE EVENTS AND THINGS SUBJECTIVELY, FROM
MY PERSPECTIVE. NATURE DOES NOT HAVE VALUES, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE
A PERSPECTIVE - VALUES ARISE FROM AWARENESS. IF I HAVE A SUBJECTIVE
PERSPECTIVE, IT IS EASY TO ASSUME THAT OTHER PEOPLE ALSO DO, AND IF
I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD IT BE LIKE IN THEIR POSITION, I WILL
EVENTUALLY DISCOVER THE GOLDEN RULE. MORALITY IS NOT NECESSARILY
A GIFT FROM HEAVENS, IN FACT, IT MAY BE A PRODUCT OF EVOLUTION.
PERHAPS WE ARE AWARE OF OURSELVES BECAUSE A SENSE OF IDENTITY
IS HELPFUL, ALLOWS US TO PLAY THE ROLES OF OTHERS AND MAKE US RESPECT
OTHERS WHO SEEM TO HAVE IDENTITY, TOO. 

BILL, HAVE YOU EVER READ ARISTOTLE? TRY HIS ETHICA NIKOMAKHEA (SP.)
FOR STARTERS.

: HOW THEN CAN AN ATHEIST JUDGE VALUE? WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR CRITICIZING
: THE VALUES ENNUMERATED IN THE BIBLE OR THE PURPOSES IMPUTED TO GOD? ON
: WHAT GROUNDS CAN THE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELIOGIOUS BE CONDEMNED? IT
: SEEMS THAT, IN JUDGING THE VALUES THAT MOTIVATE OTHERS TO ACTION, YOU
: HAVE TO HAVE SOME STANDARD AGAINST WHICH CONDUCT IS MEASURED, BUT WHAT
: IN NATURE CAN SERVE THAT PURPOSE? WHAT LAW OF NATURE CAN YOU INVOKE TO
: ESTABLISH YOUR VALUES.

C.S. LEWIS TELLS US THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY
HE ABANDONED HIS ATHEISM AND BECAME CHRISTIAN. THE ARGUMENT IS
SEVERELY FLAWED.

SOME VALUES, SUCH AS THE GOLDEN RULE, CAN HAVE A RATIONAL BASIS. SOME
OTHERS, LIKE THE BASIC IDEA OF WANTING TO LIVE, HAS PROBABLY ITS
ROOTS IN THE WAY OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED. LEWIS IGNORED THE VERY REAL
POSSIBLITY THAT NATURAL SELECTION COULD ALSO FAVOUR ALTRUISTIC
BEHAVIOUR, AND MORALITY AS WELL. INDEED, AS HUMANS EVOLVED BETTER
AND BETTER IN BUILDING AND USING TOOLS, THEY ALSO BECAME BETTER
AT KILLING EACH OTHER. IT IS A LOGICAL NECESSITY THAT EVOLUTION COULD
ONLY FAVOUR THOSE WHO KNEW HOW TO USE TOOLS, BUT NOT AGAINST ONE'S
OWN PEOPLE.

THE BIBLE REVEALS QUITE NICELY THAT THE MORALITY OF THE EARLY JEWS
WAS NOT BEYOND THIS. A SIMPLE SET OF RULES TO HOLD THE PEOPLE
TOGETHER, UNDER ONE GOD. THEIR GOD DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE
OF OTHER NATIONS. 

AT THE TIME OF THE NT, THINGS WERE QUITE DIFFERENT - THE JEWS
WERE UNDER RULE OF AN _EMPIRE_, AND COULD NO LONGER SIMPLY IGNORE
THE GENTILES. A NEW SITUATION REQUIRED A NEW MORALITY, AND ALONG
WITH IT A NEW RELIGION WAS BORN. (A MUTATION IN A MEME POOL.)

: SINCE EVERY EVENT IS ENTIRELY AND EXCLUSIVELY A PHYSICAL EVENT, WHAT
: DIFFERENCE COULD IT POSSIBLY MAKE WHAT -ANYONE- DOES, RELIGIOUS OR
: OTHERWISE, THERE CAN BE NO -MEANING- OR GRADATION OF VALUE. THE ONLY
: WAY AN ATHEIST CAN OBJECT TO -ANY- BEHAVIOUR IS TO ADMIT THAT THE
: OBJECTION IS ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE AND THAT HE(SHE) JUST DOESN'T LIKE IT
: - THAT'S IT. ANY VALUE JUDGEMENT MUST BE PREFACED BY THE DISCLAIMER
: THAT IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION AND CARRIES
: NO WEIGHT IN ANY "ABSOLUTE" SENSE.

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO READ PHILOSOPHY. WHENEVER THERE
IS AN OBSERVER, THERE IS A SUBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, WHICH MAY 
VALUE ITS EXISTENCE AND HAPPINESS (EVEN IF THAT WERE JUST A RESULT
OF SOME PHYSICAL EVENT), AND OTHER'S HAPPINESS, TOO, IF THE OBSERVER
COMES TO THINK ABOUT IT. IN AN ABSOLUTELY OBJECTIVE SENSE, THAT IS,
WITHOUT ANY OBSERVERS OR SUBJECTS, MORAL JUDGMENTS LOSE THEIR
MEANING. 

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR A VALUE TO SIMPLY EXIST WITHOUT A POINT OF
VIEW. THIS INCLUDES GODS, TOO, THEIR VALUES ARE ONLY _THEIR_ 
PERSONAL
