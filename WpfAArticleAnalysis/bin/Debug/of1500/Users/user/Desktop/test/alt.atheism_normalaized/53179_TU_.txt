THE "`LITTLE' THINGS" ABOVE WERE IN REFERENCE TO GERMANY, CLEARLY.  PEOPLE
SAID THAT THERE WERE SIMILAR THINGS IN GERMANY, BUT NO ONE COULD NAME ANY.
THEY SAID THAT THESE WERE THINGS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW, AND THAT THEY
WEREN'T GOING TO WASTE THEIR TIME REPEATING THEM.  SOUNDS TO ME LIKE NO ONE
KNEW, EITHER.  I LOOKED IN SOME BOOKS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.

IT HAS *CAUSED* PROBLEMS?  AGAIN, NO ONE HAS SHOWN THAT THINGS WERE BETTER
BEFORE THE MOTTO, OR THAT THEY'D LIKELY BE BETTER AFTER.  I DON'T THINK
THE MOTTO INITIATES ANY SORT OF HARASSMENT.  HARASSMENT WILL OCCUR WHETHER
OR NOT THE MOTTO IS PRESENT.
