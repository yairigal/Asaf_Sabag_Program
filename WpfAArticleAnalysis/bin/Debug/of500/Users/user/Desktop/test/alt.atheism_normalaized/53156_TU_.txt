       SINCE YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE MESSIAH, I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING
        TO THE NEW TESTAMENT.  PLEASE DETAIL YOUR COMPLAINTS OR E-MAIL IF
        YOU DON'T WANT TO POST.  FIRST-CENTURY GREEK IS WELL-KNOWN AND
        WELL-UNDERSTOOD.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOSEPHUS, THE JEWISH HISTORIAN,
        WHO ALSO WROTE OF JESUS?  IN ADDITION, THE FOUR GOSPEL ACCOUNTS
