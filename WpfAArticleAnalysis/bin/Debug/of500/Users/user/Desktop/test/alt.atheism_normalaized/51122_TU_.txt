TAKE YOUR FOOT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, I WONDERED ABOUT THAT ALREADY WHEN I
WAS A CATHOLIC CHRISTIAN. THE FACT THAT THE CONTRADICTION IS UNRESOLVABLE
IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM AN ATHEIST.
 
BELIEVE ME, I BELIEVED SIMILAR SENTENCES FOR A LONG TIME. BUT THAT SHOWS
THE POWER OF RELIGION AND NOT ANYTHING ABOUT ITS CLAIMS.

IT FOLLOWS FROM A DEFINITION OF EVIL AS ORDINARILY USED. LETTING EVIL
HAPPEN OR ALLOWING EVIL TO TAKE PLACE, IN THIS PLACE EVEN CAUSING EVIL,
IS ANOTHER EVIL.

THE OMNISCIENT ATTRIBUTE OF GOD WILL KNOW WHAT THE CREATURES WILL DO EVEN
BEFORE THE OMNIPOTENT HAS CREATED THEM. THERE IS NO CHOICE LEFT. ALL IS KNOWN,
THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS FIXED.
 
NOT EVEN FOR THE OMNISCIENT ITSELF, TO EXTEND AN ARGUMENT BY JAMES TIMS.
