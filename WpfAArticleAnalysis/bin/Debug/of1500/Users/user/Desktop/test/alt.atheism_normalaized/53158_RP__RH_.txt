 Personally I feel that since religion have such a poweful 
 psychological effect we should let theists be  But the problem is that 
 religions cause enormous harm to nonbelievers and to humanity as a whole 
 holy wars inquisitions interreligious hatred impedence of science 
  intellectual progress usthem attitudes etc etc  Need I say more 
 I really dont know what we can do about them  Any comments 
  
 
  I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons 
attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax 
anybody else This seems to be ok for atheists You dont get an atheist 
knocking on your door stopping you in the airport or handing out 
literature at a social event Theists seem to think that thier form of 
happy should work for others and try to make it so  
 
  My sister is a  
born again and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family 
for several years She finally got the clue that she couldnt help 
During that period she bought me I was atheist now Im Xtian books 
for my birthday and Xmas several times Our birthday cards would contain 
verses It was a problem I told my mom that I was going to send my 
sister an atheist piece of reading material I got a Dont you dare 
My mom wasnt religious Why did she insist that I not send it  
 
   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to 
preach nonreligion should be self contained What a crock of shit 
I finally told my sister that I didnt find her way of life attractive 
I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then 
 
   Im sick of religious types being pampered looked out for and WORST 
OF ALL     respected more than atheists There must be an end 
in sight
