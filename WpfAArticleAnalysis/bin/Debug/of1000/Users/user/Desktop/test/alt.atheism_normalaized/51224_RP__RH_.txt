This posting is totally uncalled for in recscouting 
 
The point has been raised and has been answered  Roger and I have 
clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue 
specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of 
the Scout Oath specifically the promise to live morally straight 
 
There is really nothing else to discuss  Trying to cloud the issue 
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless 
because its like comparing apples to oranges ie people cant 
control their race but they can control their behavior 
 
What else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue 
Nobody including BSA is denying anybody the right to live andor 
worship as they please or dont please  but it doesnt mean that BSA 
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious 
and moral standards on which our society has been established and on 
which it should continue to be based
