[ DELETIA; IN CASE ANYBODY HADN'T NOTICED, FRANK AND I ARE DEBATING
  "OBJECTIVE MORALITY", AND SEEMINGLY HITTING SEMANTICS. ]

      IT MAY BE THAT, BEING A NON-NATIVE ENGLISH-SPEAKER, I'VE
MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR USAGE OF "OBJECTIVE", AND TRIED TO DEBATE SOMETHING
YOU DON'T ASSERT; MY APOLOGIES. I'M AT A LOSS TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU REALLY
DO MEAN, THOUGH.

      WRONG POINT. THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE HAS NO DIRECT EFFECT ON
HUMANITY'S STICKING POWER, IN THE WAY THE MORAL SYSTEM OF A SOCIETY CAN
HAVE.

      I'M SAYING THE UNIVERSE HAS A "REAL AGE", BECAUSE I SEE EVIDENCE
FOR IT; COSMOLOGY, ASTRONOMY AND SO ON. I SAY THIS AGE IS INDEPENDENT OF
PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF IT, BECAUSE I KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT OPINIONS IN THE MATTER, YET EMPIRICAL TESTS CONSISTENTLY SEEM
TO GIVE ROUGHLY THE SAME RESULTS.

      I CAN'T SEE HOW IT DOES THAT. PUT A CREATIONIST TO THE TASK OF
PERFORMING THE TESTS AND CALCULATIONS, SEE TO IT (S)HE MAKES NO BLATANT
ERRORS IN MEASURING OR CALCULATING, AND THE RESULT OF THE TEST WILL BE
THE SAME.

      BECAUSE LOGICALLY CONSISTENT EMPIRICAL TESTS CONTRADICT THEIR
OPINION. IF THOSE TESTS WERE JUST MY OPINION, THEN THEIR OWN TESTS
(WHICH WOULD THEN BE
