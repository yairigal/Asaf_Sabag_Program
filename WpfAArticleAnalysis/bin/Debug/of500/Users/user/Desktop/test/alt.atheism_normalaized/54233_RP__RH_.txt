Of course not I would think that would be great fun not having ever 
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze 
This is not what I got when I believed  I just tried to hide my fear 
of getting punished for something I never was sure of The Bible is 
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure God did 
not answer In the end I found I had been following a mass delusion 
a lie I cant believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint 
of her existence

I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe 
and analyse their position In fact it is amusing to note in this 
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the

Ill tell you something I left out of my testimony I posted to this 
group two months ago A day after I finally found out my faith is over 
I decided to try just one more time The same cycle of emotional 
responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only 
a couple of hours I told my friend in a phone that it really works 
thank god just to think about it again when I hung up I had to admit 
that I had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion

I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger or what 
other people told me but I grew more and more skeptical the more I 
read I learned what it means to use reason 
 
As a student of chemistry I had to perform a qualitative analysis 
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab I hated experiments 
like this  they are oldfashioned and increase the students workload 
considerably Besides I had to do it twice since I failed in
