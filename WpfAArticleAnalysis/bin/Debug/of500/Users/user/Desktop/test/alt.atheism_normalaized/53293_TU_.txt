|>HUH?   ARE YOU BARKING MAD?

| 
|HARDLY.
| 
| 
|>(1) THEISM IS NOT AS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM AS YOU SAY.  PLUS

|>    IN THE TRUTH INSTEAD OF BEING AS YOU SEEMING ARE, A BIGOT.

| 
|THEISM IS CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM. I HAVE NEITHER SAID THAT ALL FANATISM
|IS CAUSED BY THEISM NOR THAT ALL THEISM LEADS TO FANATISM. THE POINT IS,
|THEISM INCREASES THE CHANCE OF BECOMING A FANATIC. ONE COULD OF COURSE
|ARGUE THAT WOULD BE FANATICS TEND TOWARDS THEISM (FOR EXAMPLE), BUT I JUST
|HAVE TO LOOOK AT THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN THEISM WAS THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY
|TO INVALIDATE THAT CONCLUSION THAT THAT IS THE BASIC MECHANISM BEHIND IT.

IMO, THE INFLUENCE OF STALIN, OR FOR THAT MATTER, AYN RAND, INVALIDATES YOUR 
ASSUMPTION THAT THEISM IS THE FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED.  GULLIBILITY, 
BLIND OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY, LACK OF SCEPTICISM, AND SO ON, ARE ALL MORE 
RELIABLE INDICATORS.  AND THE REALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE - THE SOURCES OF
FANATICISM - ARE OFTEN NONE OF THESE THINGS.  THEY ARE CYNICAL MANIPULATORS
OF THE GULLIBLE, WHO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  NOW, *SOME*
BRANDS OF THEISM, AND MORE PRECISELY *SOME* THEISTS, DO TEND TO FANATICISM,
I GRANT YOU.  TO TAR ALL THEISTS WITH THIS BRUSH IS BIGOTRY, NOT A REASONED
ARGUMENT - AND IT READS TO ME LIKE A WARM-UP FOR CENSORSHIP AND RESTRICTION
OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  EVER READ ANIMAL FARM?

|>(2)  DEFINE "IRRATIONAL BELIEF".  E.G., IS IT RATIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT
|>     REASON IS ALWAYS USEFUL?
|>
| 
|IRRATIONAL BELIEF IS BELIEF THAT IS NOT BASED UPON REASON. THE LATTER HAS
|BEEN DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME WITH CHARLEY WINGATE. ONE POINT IS THAT
|THE BELIEFS VIOLATE REASON OFTEN, AND ANOTHER THAT A PROCESS THAT DOES
|NOT LEND ITSELF TO RATIONAL ANALYSIS DOES NOT CONTAIN RELIABLE INFORMATION.

WELL, THERE IS A GLARING PARADOX HERE:  AN ARGUMENT THAT REASON IS USEFUL
BASED ON REASON WOULD BE CIRCULAR, AND ARGUMENT NOT BASED ON REASON WOULD
BE IRRATIONAL.  WHICH IS IT?

THE FIRST PART OF THE SECOND STATEMENT CONTAINS NO INFORMATION, BECAUSE
YOU DON'T SAY WHAT "THE BELIEFS" ARE.  IF "THE BELIEFS" ARE STRONG THEISM 
AND/OR STRONG ATHEISM, THEN
