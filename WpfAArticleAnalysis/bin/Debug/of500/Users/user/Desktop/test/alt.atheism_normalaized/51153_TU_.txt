LET ME FIRST SAY THAT "TO BELIEVE THAT NO GODS EXIST" IS IN FACT 
DIFFERENT THAN "NOT BELIEVING IN A GOD OR GODS". 

I WILL ARGUE THAT YOUR LATTER STATEMENT, "I BELIEVE THAT NO GODS EXIST"
DOES REST UPON FAITH - THAT IS, IF YOU ARE MAKING A POSITIVE STATEMENT 
THAT "NO GODS EXIST" (STRONG ATHEISM) RATHER THAN MERELY SAYING I DON'T  
KNOW AND THEREFORE DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM AND DON'T NOT BELIEVE IN THEN
(WEAK ATHEISM). ONCE AGAIN, TO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD IS DIFFERENT THAN SAYING  
I BELIEVE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST. I STILL MAINTAIN THE POSITION, EVEN 
AFTER READING THE FAQS, THAT STRONG ATHEISM REQUIRES FAITH.

BUT FIRST LET ME SAY THE FOLLOWING.
WE MIGHT HAVE A LANGUAGE PROBLEM HERE - IN REGARDS TO "FAITH" AND
"EXISTENCE". I, AS A CHRISTIAN, MAINTAIN THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST.
TO EXIST MEANS TO HAVE BEING IN SPACE AND TIME. GOD DOES NOT HAVE
BEING - GOD IS BEING. KIERKEGAARD ONCE SAID THAT GOD DOES NOT
EXIST, HE IS ETERNAL. WITH THIS SAID, I FEEL IT'S RATHER POINTLESS
TO DEBATE THE SO CALLED "EXISTENCE" OF GOD - AND THAT IS NOT WHAT
I'M DOING HERE. I BELIEVE THAT GOD IS THE SOURCE AND GROUND OF
BEING. WHEN YOU SAY THAT "GOD DOES NOT EXIST", I ALSO ACCEPT THIS
STATEMENT - BUT WE OBVIOUSLY MEAN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BY IT. HOWEVER,
IN WHAT FOLLOWS I WILL USE THE PHRASE "THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" IN IT'S
'USUAL SENSE' - AND THIS IS THE SENSE THAT I THINK YOU ARE USING IT.
I WOULD LIKE A CLARIFICATION UPON WHAT YOU MEAN BY "THE EXISTENCE OF
GOD".
 
WE ALSO MIGHT DIFFER UPON WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE
