AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH PROTISTS, THIS DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS BEING TRUE.
ARE YOU CONFUSING THIS WITH:

1) CILIATES WHICH HAVE A MACRONUCLEUS AND A MICRONUCLEUS, EACH CONTAINING
DNA (BUT IN DIFFERENT AMOUNTS). THE MICRONUCLEUS IS INVOLVED IN MITOSIS 
AND MEIOSIS, THE MACRONUCLEUS SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN "CONTROL CENTER" OF
THE CELL; OR

2) TWO GROUPS OF UNRELATED PROTISTS, EUGLENOIDS AND DINOFLAGELLATES, WHICH
SEEM TO HAVE PERMANENTLY CONDENSED CHROMOSOMES.  HOW THESE GROUPS READ
THEIR DNA IS QUITE A PUZZLE, AS MOST MODELS OF HOW GENES WORK INVOLVE 
THE CHROMOSOMES BEING UNWOUND.
