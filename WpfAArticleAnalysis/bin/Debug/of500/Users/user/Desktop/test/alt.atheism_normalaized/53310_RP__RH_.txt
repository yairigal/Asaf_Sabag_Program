Straw man you are trying to replace pragmatics by morals And what about 
a Subjectivis saying Subjectivismis better for me

Make those predictions and dont waste our time with circular definitions 
and assertions without evidence In this example when genocide is so 
commonly abhorred why does it happen so often in the context of religion 
Does it allow to conclude that there is something about religion that 
catalyses genocide Or in case it has nothing got to do with religion 
that the premise is wrong genocide is not abhorred
