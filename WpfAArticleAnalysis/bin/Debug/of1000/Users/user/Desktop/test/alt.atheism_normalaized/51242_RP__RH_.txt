Dont be so sure  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during 
World War II  If youre prepared to say Lets round these people up and 
stick them in a concentration camp without trial its only a short step to 
gassing them without trial  After all it seems that the Nazis originally 
only intended to imprison the Jews the Final Solution was dreamt up partly 
because they couldnt afford to run the camps because of the devastation 
caused by Goerings Total War  Those who werent gassed generally died of 
malnutrition or disease
