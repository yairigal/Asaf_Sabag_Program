BR>        Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you 
BR> are referring         to the New Testament  Please detail 
BR> your complaints or email if         you dont want to post 
BR>  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and         
BR> wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish 
BR> Historian         who also wrote of Jesus  In addition 
BR> the four gospel accounts		 are very much in harmony 
 
It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were 
inserted badly by later editors  As for the four gospels being in harmony 
on the issue of Jesus  You know not of what you speak  Here are a few 
contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension 
 
>The death of Judas after the betrayal of Jesus 
 
Acts 118 Now this man Judas purchased a field with the reward of  
iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his  
bowels gushed out 
 
Matt 2757 And he Judas cast down the pieces of silver in the temple  
and departed and went and hanged himself  And the chief priestsbought  
with them the potters field 
 
>What was Jesus prediction regarding Peters denial 
 
Before the cock crow  Matthew 2634 
 
Before the cock crow twice  Mark 1430 
 
>How many times did the cock crow 
 
MAR 1472  And the second time the cock crew And Peter called to mind  the  
word  that  Jesus  said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny 
me thrice And when he thought thereon he wept 
 
MAT 2674  Then began he to curse and to swear  saying  I  know not the man 
And immediately the cock crew 
MAT 2675  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus  which  said unto him 
Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice And he went out and wept 
bitterly 
 
LUK 2260  And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest  And immediately 
while he yet spake the cock crew 
LUK 2261  And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter And  Peter remembered 
the word of the Lord how he had said unto him Before the cock crow thou 
shalt deny me thrice 
 
JOH 1338  Jesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake  
Verily 
 verily I say unto thee The cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me 
thrice 
 
JOH 1827  Peter then denied  again  and  immediately  the  cock crew 
 
>destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah 
 
This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made  
Not the only time he does this either 
 
MAT 279  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet  
saying  And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was 
valued whom they of the children of Israel did value 
 
zechariah 111113 
nothing in Jeremiah remotely like 
 
What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial 
 
scarlet  Matthew 2728 
 
purple John 192 
 
>The time of the Crucifiction 
 
Mark says the third hour or 9 am but John says the sixth hour noon was 
when the sentence was passed 
 
>Inscription on the Cross 
 
Matthew    This is Jesus the king of the Jews 
Mark	   The King of the Jews 
Luke	   This is the king of the Jews 
John	   Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews 
 
>What did they give him to drink 
 
vinegar  Matthew 2734 
 
wine with myrrh  Mark 1523 
 
>Women at the Cross 
 
Matthew said many stood far off including Mary Magdaline Mary the mother of 
James and the mother of Zebedees children  Mark and Luke speak of many far 
off and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less 
John says that Jesuss mother stood at the cross along with her sister and 
Mary Magdalene 
 
>Jesus last words  
 
Matt274650 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice  
saying Eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say My God my God why 
hast thou forsaken me  Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice 
yielded u the ghost 
 
Luke2346 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said Father unto 
 thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost 
 
John1930 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is  
finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost 
 
>Events of the crucifiction 
 
Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an 
earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves 
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem appearing to 
many beating Jesus to the resurection Mark and Luke speak of darkness and 
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints  
John is the only one who mentions Jesuss side being peirced 
 
>Burial of Jesus 
 
Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being 
stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed All of this was 
supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions 
 
>How long was Jesus in the tomb 
Depends where you look Matthew 1240 gives Jesus prophesying that he will 
spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and Mark 1034 
has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again As far as I can 
see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the 
postresurrection narratives have on the third day 
 
>Time of the Resurection 
 
Matthew says Sunday at dawn Mark says the sun was rising and John says it 
was dark 
 
> Who was at the Empty Tomb  Is it  
 
MAT 281  In the end of the sabbath as it began to  dawn  toward the first 
day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre 
 
MAR 161  And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the  mother  
of  James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and 
anoint him 
 
JOH 201  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early when  it  
was  yet  dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the 
sepulchre 
 
>Whom did they see at the tomb 
 
MAT 282  And behold there was  a  great  earthquake  for  the angel of the 
Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door 
and sat upon it 
MAT 283  His countenance was like  lightning  and  his  raiment white as 
snow MAT 284  And for fear of him the keepers did shake  and  became as 
dead men MAT 285  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women  Fear 
not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified 
 
MAR 165  And entering into the sepulchre they saw a  young  man sitting  on  
the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted 
 
LUK 244  And it came  to  pass  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout 
behold two men stood by them in shining garments 
 
JOH 2012  And seeth two angels in white sitting the one at  the head  and  
the  other  at  the feet where the body of Jesus had lain 
 
>Belief that the disciples stole Jesuss body 
 
Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes 
this claim 
 
>Appearences of the risen Jesus 
 
Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two
