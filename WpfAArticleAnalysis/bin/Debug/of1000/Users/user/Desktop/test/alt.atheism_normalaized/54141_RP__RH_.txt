Could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or 
tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way  Of course this is 
essentially what we do with Homer or with other concepts such as 
fate luck free will   However there remains the question of 
whether the religious literature of  say  Christianity is a 
particularly *good* set of metaphors for the world today  Its also 
entirely unclear and to me quite unlikely that one could take a 
contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential 
from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases
