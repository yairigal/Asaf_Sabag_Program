#>#(DELETION)
#>#
#>#>|THEISM IS CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM. I HAVE NEITHER SAID THAT ALL FANATISM
#>#>|IS CAUSED BY THEISM NOR THAT ALL THEISM LEADS TO FANATISM. THE POINT IS,
#>#>|THEISM INCREASES THE CHANCE OF BECOMING A FANATIC. ONE COULD OF COURSE
#>#>|ARGUE THAT WOULD BE FANATICS TEND TOWARDS THEISM (FOR EXAMPLE), BUT I JUST
#>#>|HAVE TO LOOOK AT THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN THEISM WAS THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY
#>#>|TO INVALIDATE THAT CONCLUSION THAT THAT IS THE BASIC MECHANISM BEHIND IT.
#>#>
#>#>IMO, THE INFLUENCE OF STALIN, OR FOR THAT MATTER, AYN RAND, INVALIDATES YOUR
#>#>ASSUMPTION THAT THEISM IS THE FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED.
#>#
#>#BOGUS. I JUST SAID THAT THEISM IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR FOR FANATISM.
#>#THE POINT IS THAT THEISM IS *A* FACTOR.
#>
#>THAT'S YOUR CLAIM; NOW BACK IT UP.  I CONSIDER YOUR ARGUMENT AS USEFUL
#>AS THE FOLLOWING:  BELIEF IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM.  THEREFORE
#>BELIEF IS *A* FACTOR IN FANATICISM.  TRUE, AND UTTERLY USELESS.  (NOTE, THIS
#>IS *ANY* BELIEF, NOT BELIEF IN GODS)
#>
# 
#TIRING TO SAY THE LEAST. I HAVE BACKED IT UP, READ THE FIRST STATEMENT.

I HAVE READ IT.  CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE IS ANY EVIDENCE OR POINT.

# 
#THE LATTER IS THE FALLACY OF THE WRONG ANALOGY. SAYING SOMEONE BELIEVES
#SOMETHING IS HARDLY AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERSON AT ALL. SAYING SOMEONE
#IS A THEIST HOLDS MUCH MORE INFORMATION. FURTHER, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN
#THEISTS AND FANATISM IS HIGHER THAN THAT BETWEEN BELIEF AT ALL AND FANATISM
#BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THEISTIC BELIEF.

TRUTH BY BLATANT ASSERTION.  EVIDENCE?
# 
# 
#>#>GULLIBILITY,
#>#>BLIND OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY, LACK OF SCEPTICISM, AND SO ON, ARE ALL MORE
#>#>RELIABLE INDICATORS.  AND THE REALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE - THE SOURCES OF
#>#>FANATICISM - ARE OFTEN NONE OF THESE THINGS.  THEY ARE CYNICAL MANIPULATORS
#>#>OF THE GULLIBLE, WHO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
#>#
#>#THAT'S A CLAIM YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT. PLEASE NOTE THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE
#>#FIELD OF THEISM, THE LEADERS BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY.
#>
#>IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, YOU'RE INCREDIBLY NAIVE.
#>
# 
#YOU, FRANK O'DWYER, ARE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD. I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY
#BASE OF DISCUSSION LEFT AFTER SUCH A STATEMENT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK
#YOU ARE IGNORANT OF HUMAN NATURE. EVEN WHEN ONE STARTS WITH SOMETHING ONE DOES
#NOT BELIEVE, ONE GETS EASILY FOOLED INTO ACTUALLY BELIEVING WHAT ONE SAYS.
# 
#TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, PROVE YOUR STATEMENT.

THE ONUS OF PROOF IS ON YOU, SUNSHINE.  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT
THEIST LEADERS BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY?  ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAY
ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER, OR SAY ONE THING CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ITS
OPPOSITE?  THE PRACTICE IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THEISM, BUT IT'S THERE
FOR ANYONE TO SEE.  IT'S ALMOST AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY.

JUST FOR INSTANCE, IF IT IS HARDER FOR A CAMEL TO PASS THRU' THE EYE
OF A NEEDLE,
