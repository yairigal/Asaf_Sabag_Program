AND WHAT IS "BETTER?" BETTER IS A SUBJECTIVE VALUE JUDGEMENT.

I TELL YOU A LIE, AND AS A RESULT YOU GIVE ME ALL YOUR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF ASSETS AND MOVE TO INDIA. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, FALSEHOOD WAS A 
SUBSTANTIALLY "BETTER" THAN TELLING THE TRUTH. (HOW DO YOU THINK A
LOG OF GURUS MAKE A LIVING?)

I ATTACK YOUR COUNTRY IN WAR, KILL EVERYONE AND TAKE YOUR RICH
NATURAL RESOURCES. BEFORE I DID THIS, I WAS LIVING IN POVERTY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE WAR WAS MUCH "BETTER" THAN PEACE.

I SEE NO NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER. ONCE YOU ADDRESS THIS LITTLE ISSUE
OF "BETTERNESS" BEING NON-RELATIVISTIC WE CAN CONTINUE.
