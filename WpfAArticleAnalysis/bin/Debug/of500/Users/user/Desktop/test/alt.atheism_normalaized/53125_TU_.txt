>I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE INFINITE.

FIRST OF ALL, INFINITY IS A MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT CREATED BY HUMANS
TO EXPLAIN CERTAIN THINGS IN A CERTAIN WAY. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT ACTUALLY
APPLIES TO REALITY, WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD IS INFINITE.

>IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
>COMPREHEND WHAT REALITY IS LIKE FOR THE PROGRAMMER, BECAUSE THAT WOULD
>REQUIRE AN INFINITE MEMORY OR WHATEVER BECAUSE REALITY IS CONTINUOUS AND
>BASED ON INFINIETELY SMALL UNITS- NO UNITS.

YOU DON'T KNOW IF THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY CONTINUOUS. CONTINUUM IS ANOTHER
MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT (BASED ON INFINITY) USED TO EXPLAIN THINGS IN A CERTAIN
WAY.

>BECAUSE HUMANS DO NOT KNOW WHAT INFINITE IS.  WE CALL IT SOMETHING
>BEYOND NUMBERS.  WE CALL IT ENDLESS, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS.

I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT INFINITY IS. IT'S A MAN-MADE CONCEPT, AND
LIKE MANY MAN-MADE CONCEPTS, IT HAS EVOLVED THROUGH TIME. ANCIENT GREEKS HAD
A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF IT.

>SO, WE CAN CALL ALLAH INFINITELY POWERFUL, KNOWLEDGEABLE, ETC.., YET WE
>CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT ALLAH ACTUALLY IS, BECAUSE WE JUST CANNOT IMAGINE
>WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE INFINITE.

PRECICELY. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF INFINITY APPLIES TO REALITY.
