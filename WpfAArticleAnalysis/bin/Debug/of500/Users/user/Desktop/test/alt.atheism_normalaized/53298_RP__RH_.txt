WEBSTER  myth  a traditional or legendary story 
           a beliefwhose truth is accepted uncritically 
 
How does that qualify 
Indeed its almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance 
Ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as 
accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend 
Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but

Also 
 
>Divine justice According to the most fundamental doctrines of

You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to 
launch your own xtian mythology  This time meeting all the

it across  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesnt 
make it any more credible to me 
 
If the Bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason 
to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged 
gods alleged existance
