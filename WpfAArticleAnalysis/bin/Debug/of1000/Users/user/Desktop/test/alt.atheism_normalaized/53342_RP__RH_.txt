This is a very good point I have already made the clear claim that 
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Quran 
and have given my arguments for this This is something that can be 
checked by anyone sufficiently interested Khomeini being dead 
really cant respond but another poster who supports Khomeini has 
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry This should 
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist 
modes of obfuscationism  
 
So to answer your question the only way you can judge is by learning  
more about Islam that is by reading the Quran and understanding its  
basic principles Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see  
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at  
odds with Islam Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve  
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles  
of Islam which is that no human being is metaphysically different than  
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical  
nature
