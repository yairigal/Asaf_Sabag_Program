Yes this took some getting used to  of course not having an Indian 
connection no knowledge of hindi etc this was not trivial for me 
I did have thanks to the wonders of the net A Glossary to *Satanic 
Verses* posted to recartsbooks by Vijay Raghavan which explains a 
lot of the Indian English constructions Indian culture references 
even the Islamic references Jahilia Submission the context of 
the Satanic Verses incident etc  what I have only covers the 
first couple of hundred pages but it helped me get into the flow of 
the novel I can mail this to anyone interested if anyone has 
portions after part I if they exist Id like to get those
