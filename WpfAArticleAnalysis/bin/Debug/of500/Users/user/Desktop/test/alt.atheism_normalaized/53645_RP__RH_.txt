			RAPTURE  OCTOBER 28 1992 
 
		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE 
 
I STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC 
 
	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to 
panic  But to do so is absolutely useless now  If you had wanted to get right 
with God before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait  Now your  
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  
Tribulation  But he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be  
saved  Matthew 2413 
 
II REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION 
 
	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of 
the rapture until Christs second coming  Also know as the time of Jacobs 
Israels trouble Jere 307 and Daniels Seventieth Week Dan 9 this  
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror 
 
III GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM 
 
	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  
the revived Roman Empire Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will 
be tantamount to treason  The Bible however will be your most valuable  
possession during the Tribulation 
 
IV READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE 
 
	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it 
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can 
quote them  It is especially important to read Daniel Luke 21 Matthew 24  
Revelation and Amos for these books describe the events you can expect to 
unfold before you   
 
V PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE 
 
	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you  pray and pray  
and pray  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the 
sake of Christ   
 
VI DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST  EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED 
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS 
 
	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community he 
will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell 
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name  Money will be 
useless  And he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and  
slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that 
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the
