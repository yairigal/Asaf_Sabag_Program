ANTON LAVEY'S INTERPRETATION OF SATANISM HAS ALWAYS PUZZLED ME.  I
READ HIS "SATANIC BIBLE" A FEW YEARS AGO FOR A SOCIAL STUDIES PROJECT,
AS WELL AS A BOOK BY ARTHUR LYONS CALLED "THE CULT OF DEVIL WORSHIP
IN AMERICA."  THE LATTER INCLUDED A VERY INTERESTING INTERVIEW WITH
THE BLACK POPE IN WHICH HE DID INDEED SAY THAT SATAN WAS MERELY AN
INSTRUMENT FOR ONE TO REALIZE THE SELF.  

WHEN I REFER TO SATANISM, I AM REFERRING TO THE MISHMASH OF RURAL SATANIC
RITUALISM AND WITCHCRAFT WHICH EXISTED BEFORE THE CHURCH OF SATAN.  I
DON'T CONSIDER LAVEY'S CHURCH TO BE AT ALL "ORTHODOX," NOR DO I CONSIDER
ITS FOLLOWERS "SATANISTS."  LAVEY COMBINED THE PHILOSOPHIES OF NIETZSCHE,
CROWLEY, AND REICH, SLAPPED IN SOME RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE, ADDED A LITTLE
TOUCH OF P.T. BARNUM, AND CHRISTENED HIS CREATION THE CHURCH OF SATAN.
NO DOUBT THE TITLE WAS A CALCULATED ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION...I
SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY CALLED IT THE CHURCH OF FREE SEX.

AT ANY RATE, IT WORKED (FOR A WHILE).  IN ITS HEYDAY, THE CHURCH HAD A
HUGE FOLLOWING, INCLUDING SUCH HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES AS SAMMY DAVIS, JR.
AND JAYNE MANSFIELD.  (I HAVE A PICTURE OF LAVEY WITH SAMMY, BY THE 
WAY.)  

I FIND THE IDEA OF A SATANIST NOT BELIEVING IN SATAN ABOUT AS CREDIBLE AS
A CHRISTIAN NOT BELIEVING IN CHRIST.  BUT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CHURCH OF
SATAN, THEN I SUPPOSE I NEED TO ALTER MY DEFINITION.  WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY
AND THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY WILL HAVE TO DO THE SAME.
