Most of Scottys followup *was* irrelevant to the original question 
but this is not unusual as threads often quickly evolve away from 
the original topic  What I could not understand is why Jim spent so 
much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies

I understand what you mean by collective but I think it is an 
insane perversion of justice  What sort of judge would punish the 
descendants for a crime committed by their ancestor
