OKAY... I ARGUED THIS THOROUGHLY ABOUT 3-4 WEEKS AGO.  MEN AND WOMEN ARE
DIFFERENT ... PHYSICALLY, PHYSIOLOGICALLY, AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY.  MUCH
RECENT EVIDENCE FOR THIS STATEMENT IS PRESENT IN THE BOOK "BRAINSEX" BY
ANNE MOIR AND DAVID JESSEL.  I RECOMMEND YOU FIND A COPY AND READ IT.
THEIR BOOK IS AN OVERVIEW OF RECENT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC
AND IS WELL REFERENCED. 

NOW, IF WOMEN AND MEN ARE DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS, THE LAW CAN ONLY
ADEQUATELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEIR NEEDS IN THESE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE
DIFFERENT BY ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WAYS IN WHICH MEN AND WOMEN
ARE DIFFERENT.  MATERNITY LEAVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS -- IT TAKES INTO
ACCOUNT THAT WOMEN GET PREGNANT.  IT DOES NOT GIVE WOMEN THE SAME RULES
IT WOULD GIVE TO MEN, BECAUSE TO TREAT WOMEN LIKE IT TREATS MEN IN THIS
INSTANCE WOULD BE UNJUST.  THIS IS JUST SIMPLY AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF
WHERE MEN AND WOMEN ARE INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT!!!!!

NOW, PEOPLE MAKE THE _NAIVE_ ARGUMENT THAT SEXISM = OPPRESSION.
HOWEVER, MATERNITY LEAVE IS SEXIST BECAUSE MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. 
MEN DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO LEAVE THAT WOMEN DO (NOT TO THE SAME
EXTENT OR DEGREE), AND THEREFORE IT IS SEXIST.  NO MATTER HOWEVER MUCH A
MAN _WANTS_ TO GET PREGNANT AND HAVE MATERNITY LEAVE, HE NEVER CAN.  AND
THEREFORE THE LAW IS SEXIST.  NO MAN CAN HAVE ACCESS TO MATERNITY LEAVE,
NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR.

MATERNITY LEAVE IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE A SEXIST LAW IS JUST, BECAUSE THE
SEXISM HERE JUST REFLECTS THE "SEXISM" OF NATURE IN MAKING MEN AND WOMEN
DIFFERENT.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHICH
ARE FAR MORE SUBTLE THAN PREGNANCY, AND TO FIND OUT MORE OF THESE I
RECOMMEND YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE BOOK "BRAINSEX".

YOUR POINT THAT PERHAPS SOME DAY MEN CAN ALSO BE PREGNANT IS FALLACIOUS.
IF MEN CAN
