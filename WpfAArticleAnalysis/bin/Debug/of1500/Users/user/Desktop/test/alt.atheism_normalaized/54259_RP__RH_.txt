BR>         The problem is that most scientists exclude the 
BR> possibility of the         supernatural in the question of 
BR> origins  Is this is a fair premise         I utterly 
BR> reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of    
BR>      truth 
 
It is better than the crap that the creationists put out  So far all they 
have been able to manage is distortions and halftruths When they are not 
taking quotes out of context 
 
BR>         Some of these socalled humanlike creatures were 
BR> apes  Some were         humans  Some were fancifully 
BR> reconstructed from fragments  
 
The genetic code has shown more about how man is realted to primates that the 
fossil record  A little detail the creationists try and ignore 
 
BR>            Good deeds do not justify a person in Gods 
BR> sight            An atonement Jesus is needed to atone 
BR> for sin 
 
Who says  Your Bibletm	I would be surprised if *ANY* Christian followed 
all of the rules in the Bible  Most of them just pick and choose according 
to the local biases 
 
BR>      My point God is the creator  Looks like we agree 
 
Where is your proof  How do you know it was *YOUR* God 
 
BR>      Ill send you some info via email 
BR>      Regards Bill 
 
Why not post them	I would be interested in seeing them myself
