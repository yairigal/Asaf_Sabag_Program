I see the point on falsifying God as per the scientific method  A question 
Ive always wanted to ask is this When scientists say that the second law 
does not apply to the earth they say it is because it is not a closed system  
ie there is energy coming in from an outside force  namely the sun  Is

a closed system have you been to the outside to look in  If it is open how  
do you know
