I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym  My Greek isnt up to much but 
it goes something like this 
 
	Jesus Christ God => Iesus CHristos THeos => Ichthos 
 
which is the Greek for fish as in eg ichthysaurus 
 
Apologies for my dreadful Greek  Perhaps someone will correct it 
 
By the way what does your sig mean
