I WOULDN'T PUNISH HIM WITH ETERNAL TORTURE IF HE DIDN'T LOVE ME. BUT THEN
I;M A DECENT CHAP. IT SEEMS YOUR GOD ISN'T.

I'VE LOOKED, AND HE WASN'T. ANOTHER PROMISE BROKEN.

DON'T FORGET TO SING:
            THEY SAY THERE'S A HEAVEN FOR THOSE WHO WILL WAIT
                SOME SAY IT'S BETTER, BUT I SAY IT AIN'T
        I'D RATHER LAUGH WITH THE SINNERS THAN CRY WITH THE SAINTS
                     THE SINNERS ARE MUCH MORE FUN
                         ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG!
