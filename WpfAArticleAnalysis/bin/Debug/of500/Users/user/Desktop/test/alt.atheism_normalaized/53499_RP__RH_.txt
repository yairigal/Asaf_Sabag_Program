Kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little 
about algorithms Your reasoning as I see it is very much along the 
lines of Roger Penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot 
be algorithmic in his book The emperors new mind Concerning 
computers minds and the laws of physics However Penroses 
claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim 
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look 
could be just illusions 
 
We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints  I try to ponder 
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective 
realising that it might not be anything special but certainly 
useful Thinking back of what I wrote do you think worms have minds 
or not They are able to experience pain at least they behave  
just like that Yet it is conceivable that we might some day 
in the future perform a total synthesis of C elegans from 
the elements Would such a worm have a mind

This is true to some extent However I do not think that our brains 
work like computers at all In fact there is substantial evidence 
Skarda 1985 Skarda  Freeman 1987 that brains work more or less 
chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve 
Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators I suppose

Indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture 
on our mind and brain I suggest however that before trying to 
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms  
 
Kevin take a look at the references I mentioned and think again 
I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind 
are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not  
flame me for my opinions since they study
