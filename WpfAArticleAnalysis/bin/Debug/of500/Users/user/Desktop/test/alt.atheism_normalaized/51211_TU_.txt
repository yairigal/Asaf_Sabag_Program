THIS KIND OF ARGUMENT CRIES FOR A COMMENT...

DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THIS? IF THE CODE WAS ONCE PERFECT, AND
HAS DEGRADED EVER SINCE, WE _SHOULD_ HAVE SOME EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR
OF THIS STATEMENT, SHOULDN'T WE?

PERHAPS THE BIGGEST "IMPERFECTION" OF THE CODE IS THAT IT IS FULL
OF NON-CODING REGIONS, INTRONS, WHICH ARE SO CALLED BECAUSE THEY
INTERVENE WITH THE CODING REGIONS (EXONS). AN IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INTRONS ARE OF VERY ANCIENT ORIGIN; IT IS
LIKELY THAT EARLY EXONS REPRESENTED EARLY PROTEIN DOMAINS.

IS THE NUMBER OF INTRONS DECREASING OR INCREASING? IT APPEARS THAT
INTRON LOSS CAN OCCUR, AND SPECIES WITH COMMON ANCESTRY USUALLY
HAVE QUITE SIMILAR EXON-INTRON STRUCTURE IN THEIR GENES. 

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POSSIBILITY THAT INTRONS HAVE BEEN INSERTED
LATER, PRESENTS SEVERAL LOGICAL DIFFICULTIES. INTRONS ARE REMOVED
BY A SPLICING MECHANISM - THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE PRESENT, BUT UNUSED,
IF INTRONS ARE INSERTED. MOREOVER, INTRON INSERTION WOULD HAVE
REQUIRED _PRECISE_ TARGETING - RANDOM INSERTION WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED,
SINCE SEQUENCES FOR INTRON REMOVAL (SELF-SPLICING OF MRNA) ARE
CONSERVED. BESIDES, TRANSPOSITION OF A SEQUENCE USUALLY LEAVES A
TRACE - LONG TERMINAL REPEATS AND TARGET - SITE DUPLICATIONS, AND
THESE ARE NOT FOUND IN OR NEAR INTRON SEQUENCES. 

I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND READING TEXTBOOKS ON MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND
GENETICS BEFORE POSTING "THEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS" LIKE THIS. 
TRY WATSON'S MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE GENE OR DARNELL, LODISH
& BALTIMORE'S MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL FOR STARTERS.

: REMEMBER, THE QUESTION WAS POSED IN A THEOLOGICAL CONTEXT (WHY DOES
: GOD CAUSE DISEASE IN NEWBORNS?), AND MY ANSWER IS LIKEWISE FROM A
: THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE -- MY OWN.  IT IS NO LESS VALID THAN A PURELY
: SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE, JUST DIFFERENT.

SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE IS SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE, WHEREAS 
THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES OFTEN FAIL TO FULFIL THIS CRITERION.
 
: I THINK YOU MISREAD MY MEANING.  I SAID GOD MADE THE GENETIC CODE PERFECT,
: BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECT NOW.  IT HAS CERTAINLY EVOLVED SINCE.

FOR THE WORSE? WOULD YOU PLEASE CITE A FEW REFERENCES THAT SUPPORT
YOUR ASSERTION? YOUR ASSERTION IS LESS VALID THAN THE SCIENTIFIC
PERSPECTIVE, UNLESS YOU SUPPORT IT BY SOME EVIDENCE.

IN FACT, IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT PARASITES AND DISEASES ARE PERHAPS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WE'VE THOUGHT - FOR INSTANCE, SEX MIGHT
HAVE EVOLVED AS DEFENCE AGAINST PARASITES. (THIS VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY
COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF EVOLUTION, EG TIERRA.) 
 
: PERHAPS.  I THOUGHT IT WAS HIGHER ENERGY RAYS LIKE X-RAYS, GAMMA
: RAYS, AND COSMIC RAYS THAT CAUSED MOST OF THE DAMAGE.

IN FACT, IT IS THERMAL
