No but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get 
to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful 
The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major 
defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now and 
is the part of both disciplines as social psychology that strikes me 
as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the 
net 
 
An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of social norms in 
action is the micro sociology of Ervin Goffman  There are some very 
good introductory essays Deference and Demeanor is a classic as 
well as accessible books like Interaction Ritual  More difficult and 
theoretical are some of his later books like Frame Analysis  But even 
at his most academic Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily 
jargonladen theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable 
 
Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in 
the setting of their expectations of other people and others expectations 
of them  This becomes systematized in a socially mandated way simply 
because otherwise wed have to invent the entire context of interpersonal 
realtions with every single interaction  and we engage in social inter 
actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day so that a renego 
tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion 
We simply learn it most of it early along with language which is one 
of the main exemplars
