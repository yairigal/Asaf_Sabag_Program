ABSTRACT QUESTIONS IN ISOLATION. YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE IN THE
|> FALSITY OF PRINCIPLES BY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR ABUSE. YOU MUST *HATE*
|> PHYSICS!

YOU'RE CLOSER THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.   I CERTAINLY DESPISED LIVING
UNDER THE SOVIET REGIME WHEN IT PURPORTED TO ORGANIZE SOCIETY ACCORDING
TO WHAT THEY FONDLY IMAGINED TO BE THE "OBJECTIVE" CONCLUSIONS OF
MARXIST DIALECTIC.

BUT I DON'T HATE PHYSICS SO LONG AS SOME CLOWN DOESN'T START TRYING
TO CONTROL MY LIFE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE ARE ALL INTERCHANGEABLE
ATOMS, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS.
