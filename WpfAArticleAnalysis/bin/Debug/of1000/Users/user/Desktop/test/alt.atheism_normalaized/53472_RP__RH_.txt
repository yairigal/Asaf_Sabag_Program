Bill I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism Lack of  
belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding 
transcendental values I hope you would accept the fact that  
for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to nonempirical 
reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism 
 
I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might  
revise and fine tune your understanding of nonChristian systems 
 
Cheers 
Kent
