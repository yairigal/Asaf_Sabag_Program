So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini Hussein 
et rest They could still be considered true Muslims and you cant 
judge them because this is something between God and the person 
 
You have to apply your rule as well with atheistsagnostics you 
dont know their belief this is something between them and God 
 
So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim and the 
hoopla about atheists being not real human beings
