THE NUMBER OF CIVILIAN IRAQI DEATHS WERE WAY OVER-EXAGGERATED AND 
EXPLOITED FOR ANTI-WAR EMOTIONALISM BY THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA.  THE
FACTS ARE THAT LESS IRAQIS DIED IN THE GULF WAR THAN DID CIVILIANS 
IN ANY OTHER WAR OF COMPARABLE SIZE THIS CENTURY!  THIS WAS DUE MOSTLY
TO THE SHORT DURATION COUPLED WITH PRECISE SURGICAL BOMBING TECHNIQUES
WHICH WERE TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE ONLY RECENTLY.

THE IDEA THAT "HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS" OF IRAQI CITIZENS DIED IS
LUDICROUS.  NOT EVEN "HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS" OF IRAQI SOLDIERS DIED,
AND THEY WERE THE ONES BEING TARGETED!  OR DO YOU THINK THAT THE US
AND ITS ALLIES WERE SPECIFICALLY OUT TO KILL AND MAIM IRAQI CIVILIANS?
EITHER THE SMART BOMBS DIDN'T HIT THEIR TARGETS (AND WE KNOW THEY DID),
OR THEY WERE TARGETING CIVILIAN TARGETS (!) WHICH IS HARDLY CONDUSIVE TO
DESTROYING IRAQ'S MILITARY POTENTIAL.  THE MILITARY MISSION PLANNERS ARE
NOT FOOLS, THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO HIT *MILITARY* TARGETS TO WIN A WAR.
HITTING CIVILIAN TARGETS DOES NOTHING BUT UNITE THE PEOPLE AGAINST YOU,
NOT A LAUDABLE GOAL IF ONE WANTS THE PEOPLE TO RISE UP AGAINST THEIR
TYRANT-DICTATOR.

HOW ABOUT ALL THE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO DIED IN BLANKET-BOMBING IN WW2?
I DON'T HEAR YOU BEMOANING THEM!  WAR IS NEVER AN EXACT SCIENCE, BUT
WITH SMART
