ABSTRACT RIGHTS/AGREEMENTS ON HOW WE SHOULD TREAT EACH OTHER:
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE HURT BY THEM OR THEIR NOTIONS.  FOR ALL THE WELL-PUT
ARGUMENTS ON THIS USENET, IT NEVER DOES ANY GOOD.  ARGUMENTATION DOES NOT
REALLY SEEM TO APPLY TO CHRISTIANS (OR EVEN SOME ATHEISTS)- IT MUST SIMPLY BE A
STEP THE PERSON TAKES NATURALLY, ALMOST, "INSTINCTIVELY"...


BEST REGARDS,
