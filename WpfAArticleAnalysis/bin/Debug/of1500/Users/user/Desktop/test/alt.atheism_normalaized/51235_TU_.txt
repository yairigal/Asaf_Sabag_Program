YES, BUT ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TRYING TO MAKE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZE
CHRISTIANITY AS THE DOMINANT RELIGION IN THIS COUNTRY DO NO THINK
THE MOTTO INFRINGES UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS WHO DO NOT SHARE THEIR
BELIEFS.

AND ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY DOES RECOGNIZE THAT
CHRISTIANITY IS THE DOMINANT RELIGION IN THIS COUNTRY.  I MEAN, IT IS.
DON'T YOU REALIZE/RECOGNIZE THIS?

THIS ISN'T TO SAY THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THE TEACHINGS OF
CHRISTIANITY, JUST THAT MOST PEOPLE DO.

IF YOU AGREE WITH ME, THEN WHAT ARE WE DISCUSSING?

NO, BUT I HEAR QUITE A BIT ABOUT CHRISTMAS, AND LITTLE IF ANYTHING ABOUT
JESUS.  WOULDN'T THIS FIGURE BE MORE PROMINENT IF THE HOLIDAY WERE REALLY
ASSOCIATED TO A HIGH DEGREE WITH HIM?  OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE
ASSOCIATION WITH JESUS IS ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, AND THAT EVERYONE THINKS
ABOUT IT BUT JUST NEVER TALKS ABOUT IT?

THAT IS, CAN *YOU* PROVE THAT MOST PEOPLE *DO* ASSOCIATE CHRISTMAS
MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH JESUS?

>ANYWAYS, THE POINT AGAIN IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO ASSOCIATE
>CHRISTMAS WITH JESUS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THESE PEOPLE ARE A MAJORITY
>OR NOT.

I THINK THE NUMBERS *DO* MATTER.  IT TAKES A MAJORITY, OR AT LEAST A
MAJORITY OF THOSE IN POWER, TO DISCRIMINATE.  DOESN'T IT?
