No look again While you never *said* it the implication is pretty clear 
Im sorry but I can only respond to your words not your true meaning Usenet 
is a slippery medium

Look Im not supporting *any* dogmatic position Id be a fool to say that 
in the large group of people that are atheists no people exist who wish to 
proselytize in the same fashion as religion How many hard atheists do you  
see posting here anyway Maybe Imm just not looking hard enough

I never meant to do so although I understand where you might get that idea 
I was merely using the bible example as an allegory to illustrate my 
point

Guilty as charged What I *meant* to say was the theists who *are* arrogant 
are this way because they say   Other than that I thought my meaning 
was clear enough Any position that claims itself as superior to another with 
no supporting evidence is arrogant Thanks for your apology btw
