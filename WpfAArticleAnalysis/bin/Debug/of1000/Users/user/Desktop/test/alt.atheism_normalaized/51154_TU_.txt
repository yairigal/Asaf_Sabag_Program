THERE ARE DEFINITELY QUITE A FEW HORRIBLE DEATHS AS THE RESULT OF BOTH
ATHEISTS AND THEISTS.  I'M SURE BOBBY CAN LIST QUITE A FEW FOR THE ATHEIST
SIDE BUT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE THEISTS ARE EQUALLY PROFICIENT AT
GENOCIDE.  PERHAPS, SINCE I'M A BIT WEAK ON HISTORY, SOMONE HERE WOULD LIKE
TO GIVE A LIST OF WARS CAUSED/LED BY THEISTS?  I CAN THINK OF A FEW (HITLER
CLAIMED TO BE A CHRISTIAN FOR EXAMPLE) BUT A MORE COMPLETE LIST WOULD
PROBABLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SHOWING BOBBY JUST HOW ABSURD HIS STATEMENT
IS.

> PEACE,

ON A SIDE NOTE, I NOTICE YOU ALWAYS SIGN YOUR POSTS "PEACE".  PERHAPS YOU
SHOULD TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE AND LEAVE THE ATHEISTS IN PEACE WITH THEIR
BELIEFS?
