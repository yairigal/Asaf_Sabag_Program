It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not 
the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of God 
and then in the same post say that these other processes volcanos et al 
are natural occurrences  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are 
natural processes and what are direct acts of God  How do you know that 
God doesnt cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose 
in mind  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature Ive seen in 
the bible

Adam  Eve TWO PEOPLE even tho they had the honor or so you christians 
claim of being the first two definitely do NOT represent a majority in 
the billions and trillions probably more of people that have come after 
them  Perhaps they were the majority then but *I* and YOU werent 
around to vote and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to 
do with that tree  But your god never asked us  He just assumes that if 
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad  Hmm  Sounds like the 
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting 
here resorting to  So THATs where they get it shoulda known
