	A HUMAN HAS GREATER CONTROL OVER HIS/HER ACTIONS, THAN A 
PREDOMINATELY INSTICTIVE TIGER.

	A PROPER ANALOGY WOULD BE:

	IF YOU ARE THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH A PERSON AND GET MAULED, DO YOU 
BLAME THAT PERSON?

	YES. [ PROVIDING THAT THAT PERSON WAS IN A RESPONSIBLE FRAME OF 
MIND, EG NOT CLINICALY INSANE, ON PCB'S, ETC. ]
