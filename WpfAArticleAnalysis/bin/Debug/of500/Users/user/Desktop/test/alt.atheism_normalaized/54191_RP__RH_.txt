Sorry Fred but for the purposes under discussion here I must 
disagree  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue 
against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires since 
those did not represent *true* communism  In judging the practical 
consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today 
it is precisely the Khomeinis of the world the Rushdiefatwa 
supporters and perhaps more importantly the reaction of the world 
Muslim community to those extremists that we must look to  Perhaps 
unfortunately from your perspective most people are not concerned 
with whether Islam is the right religion for them or whether the 
Quran could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia but how 
Islam affects the world around them or what their lives might be like 
if Islam gains in influence  When I consider such possibilities it 
is with not inconsiderable fear
