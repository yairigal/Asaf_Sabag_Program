: BOBBY "CIRCULAR" MOZUMDER

I'M NOT SURE MY NEW NOM D'NET IS EXACTLY APPROPRIATE, BUT IT COMES
VERY CLOSE. CONSIDERING WHAT I HAVE TO WADE THROUGH BEFORE I MAKE ONE
OF MY INSIGHTFUL, DEAD-ON-THE-MONEY REPSONSES, I HAVE TO AGREE THAT
SOMETHING'S GETTING STIRRED UP. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE MY
CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT I RESPOND TO WOULD BE KINDER THOUGH, BUT IF
YOU INSIST ...

I AM ALSO SURPRISED TO FIND THAT I HAVE OFFENDED ANYONE, BUT IN SOME
CASES IT'S UNAVOIDABLE IF I AM TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. FOR THOSE TO
WHOM FAIRNESS IS IMPORTANT, CHECK OUT MY CONTRIBUTIONS, HAVEN'T I BEEN
MOST GENEROUS AND PATIENT, A VERITABLE PARAGON OF GENTILITY?

OH, BTW, I DON'T MIND BEING PAIRED WITH BOBBY; I ADMIRE HIS TENACITY.
HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD DO AS WELL IN THIS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT - YOU
THINK -I'M- OFFENSIVE ?! READ YOUR OWN POSTS ...

LOVE AND KISSES,

BILL

P.S.

MY NAME IS CONNER, NOT CONNOR. NO POINT IN HUMILIATING THE INNOCENTS.
