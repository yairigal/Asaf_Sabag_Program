YUP, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.  MY MISTAKE.  NOW, HOW DO I MAKE
AN "R" BACKWARDS USING A COMPUTER KEYBOARD?

I'LL BET THE GODS KNOW HOW (THIS IS ALT.ATHEISM, AFTER
ALL).  TELL YOU WHAT, IF ALL MY "R"S START COMING OUT
BACKWARDS WHEN I TYPE FROM NOW ON, I'LL BECOME A BELIEVER.

(AND THAT'S NOT ASKING FOR MIRACLES.  IF I ASKED FOR A MIRACLE,
I'D ASK FOR A REAL MIRACLE, LIKE FOR PAT BUCHANAN TO BECOME
AN OUT-OF-THE-CLOSET DRAG QUEEN - WELL...MAYBE THAT WOULDN'T BE
SO MIRACULOUS, BUT I THINK HE'D LOOK FABULOUS IN A FEATHER
BOA AND A SEQUINED HAT LIKE MIA FARROW WORE IN GATSBY.)
