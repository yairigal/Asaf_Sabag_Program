Its partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value its 
results  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories 
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively 
valued as objective correct or anything else  One cannot attach 
any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason 
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything   
 
However not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued so are 
the inputs  More problems  Which facts to observe   What 
is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather 
than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I 
do  As a loyal relativist I must assume that whats signal for me 
may not be signal for you  The objectivity postulate should not sit 
well with me 
 
So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should  
be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need  
satisfy noone  GIGO
