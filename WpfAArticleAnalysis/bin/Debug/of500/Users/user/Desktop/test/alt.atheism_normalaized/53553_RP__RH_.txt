 I have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure  Please 
 post the source so its reliability can be judged   
 
This figure would not simply be deaths by bombing but also death later 
from disease the sewer system of Baghdad was deliberately targeted and 
starvation I believe but when I get a copy of the latest research in 
June or July that this was the figure proposed in the Census Bureau  
report on the matter The report was suppressed and the CB attempted to 
sack the author of the report but failed due to procedural technicality 
The author is now on permanent leave
