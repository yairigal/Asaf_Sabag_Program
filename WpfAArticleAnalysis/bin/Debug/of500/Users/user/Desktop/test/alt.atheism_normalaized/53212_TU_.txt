AS MUCH AS I CONSIDERED SOME OF THE (SO-CALLED) ISLAM-RELATED DIALOGUE
HERE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, I SOMEHOW CAN'T RESTRAIN MYSELF IN THIS
INSTANCE, SO, GREGG, TRY THIS:

20:52 P.S.T.  I COME TO MY SENSES AND ACCEPT THE ALL-KNOWING
WISDOM AND POWER OF THE QURAN AND ALLAH.  NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ALLAH 
HIMSELF DROPS BY TO CONGRATULATE ME ON MY WISE CHOICE. ALLAH ROLLS A
FEW BONES AND WE GET DOWN.  THEN ALLAH GETS OUT THE CRISCO, BENDS 
OVER, AND INVITES ME TO TAKE A SPIN AROUND THE BLOCK.  WOW.

20:56 P.S.T.  I REALIZE THAT MAYBE ALLAH IS LOOKING FOR MORE OF A 
COMMITMENT THAN I'M READY FOR, SO I SAY "MAN, I'VE GOT SOME
PROGRAMMING TO DO.  GOTTA GO.  I'LL CALL YOU."

20:59 P.S.T   THINKING IT OVER, I RENOUNCE ISLAM.

BTW, GREGG, ALLAH SAID HE STILL THINKS OF YOU.

JIM
