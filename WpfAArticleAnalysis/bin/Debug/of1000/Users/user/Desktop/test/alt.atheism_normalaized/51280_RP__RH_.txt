 How about this description An object that is at one time both a 
Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle I hold that no object satisfying 
this description could exist The description is inconsistent and hence 
describes an object that could not exist 
 Now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said That object is 
at one time both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle This does 
not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description 
was incorrectly applied 
  
 The atheist says The descriptions of God that I have been presented with 
are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist 
 Now your position so far as I can gather is that God exists but the 
descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions 
of It 
 This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and 
when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one 
are told that it is a Euclidean circlesquare Can they be blamed for 
doubting rather strongly that this bicycle exists at all
