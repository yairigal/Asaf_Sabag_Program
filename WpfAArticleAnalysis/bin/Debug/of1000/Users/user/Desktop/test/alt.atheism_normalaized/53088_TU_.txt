	YES:

	IF ONE'S PARTICULAR GOAL IS TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON, OR TO 
PUT A COMMUNICATION SATTELITE INTO A ORBIT WITHIN WHICH IT WILL OPERATE; 
THEN ORBITAL ASTRONOMY WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT.

	HOWEVER, IF ONE IS A PARTICULAR FAN SONIC'S SINGING, OR A COMPETATOR 
OF SONIC, SAY MARIO AND THE TOADSTOOLS; KNOWING WHEN HE WILL RECORD AN ABLUM 
WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT.

	I FAIL TO SEE HOW THIS IS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, NOR WHERE YOU ARE 
DRIVING TOO.
