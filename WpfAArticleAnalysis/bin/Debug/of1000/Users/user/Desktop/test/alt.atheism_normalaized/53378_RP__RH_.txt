Suppose Xist saucers land  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo 
666 on peoples foreheads and start sacrificing small children  Then a 
bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the Xists in return 
for one dollar  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during 
the purge 
 
Get the point  None of these events are *inherently* impossible  So it is 
not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality 
 
For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant 
consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation 
 
You are with a bunch of friends  You have a 10 bill  You offer to sell the 
10 bill to the highest bidder  subject to the restriction that you also 
get to take the money bid by the secondhighest bidder 
 
Try it  Youll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than 10 
for your 10 bill
