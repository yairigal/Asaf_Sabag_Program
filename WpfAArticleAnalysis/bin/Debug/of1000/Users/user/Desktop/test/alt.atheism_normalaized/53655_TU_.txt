IS IT JUST ME, OR HAS THIS PART GOTTEN BEYOND USEFUL?

GREGG IS NOT, AS I UNDERSTAND HIS POSTS, GIVING ANY SUPPORT TO THE BOUNTY
ON RUSHDIE'S LIFE.  IF THAT'S CORRECT, END OF ONE POINT...

GREGG IS USING THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL IN A WAY MOST WESTERNERS DON'T ACCEPT.
HIS COMMENTS ABOUT ISLAMIC LAW I THINK MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE TO HIM,
AND ARE EVEN MAKING A _LITTLE_ SENSE TO ME NOW - IF A PERSON IS A MEMBER
OF A GROUP (RELIGION OR WHATEVER) THEY BIND THEMSELVES TO FOLLOW THE WAYS
OF THE GROUP WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT THE GROUP REQUIRES AS A MINIMUM.
THE BIG BONE OF CONTENTION HERE THAT I'M PICKING UP IS THAT IN THE WEST
WE HAVE SECULAR GOVERNMENTS THAT MAINTAIN, MORE OR LESS, A LEVEL OF CONTROL
AND OF REQUIREMENTS OUTSIDE THE REQUIREMENTS OF OPTIONAL GROUPS.  I THINK
THE MAJORITY OF US READING THIS THREAD ARE IN TUNE (NOTE - I DIDN'T SAY
"IN AGREEMENT") WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE FINALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE
SECULAR GOVERNMENT,  AND WITHIN THAT TO THE GROUP OR GROUPS A PERSON MAY
HAVE CHOSEN.

WITH THAT IN MIND, IT NOT POSSIBLE UNDER SECULAR LAW ("LEGALLY" AS MOST
PEOPLE WOULD DEFINE THE TERM) TO HOLD A PERSON TO A PARTICULAR GROUP ONCE
THEY DECIDE TO SEPARATE FROM IT.  ONLY IF THE SECULAR AUTHORITIES AGREE
THAT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT OF SOME SORT (CONTRACTUAL, ETC) IS THERE
ANY SECULAR _ENFORCEMENT_ ALLOWED BY A GROUP TO A GROUP MEMBER OR PAST
GROUP MEMBER.

A RELIGION CAN, AND OFTEN DOES, BELIEVE IN AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DUTIES
OF A GROUP MEMBER.  AND IT CAN ENFORCE THE FULFILLMENT OF THOSE DUTIES
IN MANY WAYS - OSTRACISM IS COMMON FOR EXAMPLE.  BUT THE LIMIT COMES WHEN
THE ENFORCEMENT WOULD IMPOSE UNWANTED AND/OR UNACCEPTED ONUS ON A PERSON
_IN CONFLICT WITH SECULAR LAW_.

THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE.  IN A THEOCRACY, THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECULAR
AUTHORITIES ARE, BY DEFINITION, CONGRUENT WITH THE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES.
OUTSIDE A THEOCRACY, THIS IS NOT _NECESSARILY_ TRUE.  RELIGIOUS REQUIREMENTS
_MAY_ COINCIDE OR MAY NOT.  SIMILIARLY, RELIGIOUS CONSEQUENCES _MAY_ OR
MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH SECULAR CONSEQUENCES (IF ANY).

REGARDS,

DEW
