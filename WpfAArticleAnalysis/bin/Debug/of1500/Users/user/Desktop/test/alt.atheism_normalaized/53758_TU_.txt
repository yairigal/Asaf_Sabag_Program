I THINK MANY READING THIS GROUP WOULD ALSO BENEFIT BY KNOWING HOW
DEVIANT THE VIEW _AS I'VE ARTICULATED IT ABOVE_ (WHICH MAY NOT BE
THE TRUE VIEW OF KHOMEINI) IS FROM THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM. 
SO THAT THE NON-MUSLIM READERS OF THIS GROUP WILL SEE HOW FAR FROM 
THE SIMPLE BASICS OF ISLAM SUCH VIEWS ARE ON THE FACE OF THEM. AND 
IF THEY ARE _NOT_ IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE BASICS OF ISLAM, HOW 
SUBTLE SUCH ISSUES ARE AND HOW IT SEEMS SECTS EXIST IN ISLAM WHILE 
THEY ARE EXPLICITLY PROSCRIBED BY THE QUR'AN.


>THE TOPIC IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE WORLD VIEW OF ISLAM AND THE
>ESOTERIC TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET (S.A.). HERESY DOES NOT ENTER
>INTO IT AT ALL EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO SEE ISLAM ONLY AS AN EXOTERIC
>RELIGION THAT IS ONLY NOMINALLY (IF AT ALL) CONCERNED WITH THE METAPHYSICAL
>SUBSTANCE OF MAN'S BEING AND NATURE.


IN MY OPINION CONSIDERING ANY HUMAN BEING AS HAVING A SUBSTANCE
OR METAPHYSICAL FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER HUMAN
BEING _IS_ A HERETICAL NOTION AND ONE PROSCRIBED BY ISLAM. 


>FROM YOUR POSTS, YOU SEEM FAIRLY WELL VERSED IN SUNNI THOUGHT. YOU
>SHOULD SEEK TO KNOW SHI'ITE THOUGHT THROUGH KNOWLEDGEABLE 
>SHI'ITE AUTHORS AS WELL - AT LEAST THAT MUCH RESPECT IS DUE BEFORE THE
>CHARGE OF HERESY IS LEVELLED.


ABSOLUTELY! I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THIS PRIVATELY AND
I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING HOW ONE MIGHT TRY TO MAKE THE CONCEPT OF
ERROR-FREE AND SINLESS HUMAN BEINGS PHILOSOPHICALLY CONSISTENT WITH
THE TEACHINGS OF THE QUR'AN. HOWEVER, _PRIMA FACIE_ SUCH ATTEMPTSA
ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEGENERATING INTO MONKERY, EXPLICITLY
PROSCRIBED BY THE QUR'AN.
