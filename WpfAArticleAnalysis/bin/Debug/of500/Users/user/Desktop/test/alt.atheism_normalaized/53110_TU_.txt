FALSE DICHOTOMY.  YOU CLAIMED THE KILLING WERE *NOT* RELIGIOUSLY
MOTIVATED, AND I'M SAYING THAT'S WRONG.   I'M NOT SAYING THAT
EACH AND EVERY KILLING IS RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATE, AS I SPELLED OUT
IN DETAIL.

DOES ANYONE ELSE SEE THE CONTRADICTION IN THIS PARAGRAPH?

SORRY, FRANK, BUT WHAT I PUT IN QUOTES IS YOUR OWN WORDS FROM YOUR
POSTING <1QI83B$EC4@HORUS.AP.MCHP.SNI.DE>.  DON'T TELL US NOW THAT 
IT'S A DIFFERENT CLAIM.   IF YOU CAN NO LONGER STAND BEHIND YOUR 
ORIGINAL CLAIM, JUST SAY SO.

JON.
