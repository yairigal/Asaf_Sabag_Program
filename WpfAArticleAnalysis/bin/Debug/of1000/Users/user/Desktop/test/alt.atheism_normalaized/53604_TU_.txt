I BOUGHT A COPY OF THE SATANIC VERSES WHEN THERE WAS TALK OF THE BRITISH
GOVERNMENT BANNING IT.  THERE'S NOTHING INTERESTS ME IN A BOOK MORE THAN
MAKING IT ILLEGAL.

HOWEVER, IT'S STILL SITTING ON MY SHELF UNREAD.  PERHAPS I'LL GET ROUND TO IT
SOON.  I'VE STILL GOT A PILE OF LEM, BULGAKOV AND ZAMYATIN TO GO THROUGH; I
DON'T FIND NEARLY ENOUGH TIME TO READ.  IN FACT, THERE ARE FAR MORE
INTERESTING THINGS TO DO THAN I CAN EVER FIND TIME FOR; HOW ANYONE EVER
MANAGES TO BE BORED IS BEYOND ME.  IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO SLEEP, MAYBE I COULD
MANAGE IT.
