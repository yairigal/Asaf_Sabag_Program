>Ill yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way 
>to discuss it  If youre interested in a change heres an idea 
 
	Do you believe in absolute morality And do you have absolute 
knowledge Mere mortal you And if you claim that your God has absolute 
knowledge then you have have absolute knowledge of that 
 
	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God and 
in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to but the prophets 
no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals 
then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of 
God have got it right Also you read their words in translation which 
invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage and then how do you 
know that you got the right message I assert that you do not and that 
you do not have absolute knowledge of anything including absolute morals 
 
	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to 
prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group 
you have aligned yourself to 
 
>If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that  
 
	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to 
man How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of 
established religion is anything other than social convention One 
way is to assert that there are moral universals But that is not 
the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen 
to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties 
 
>What right do 
>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality 
 
	We expect empathy from our fellow man We expect to raise each 
generation with values that we live by those which assure that mistakes 
we have made are not repeated Do you think that mere authority checks 
all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life I think not In fact 
authority is power and power corrupts The most powerful tend to think 
that they are above the law that applies to everybody else Religious 
authority theocarcy has not mitigated this any better than other 
power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no 
checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses 
recorded by history are greater 
 
	We live and teach morals by setting an example starting in 
the home This does not come from books or authority figures in 
soceity If people are weak or confused at the present time it is 
not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some 
mysterious moral
