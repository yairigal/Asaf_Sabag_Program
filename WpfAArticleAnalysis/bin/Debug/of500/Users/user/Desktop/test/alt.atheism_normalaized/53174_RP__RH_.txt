What Ive been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior 
That is it doesnt take much work to be moral but it certainly does to 
be immoral in some cases  Also Ive said that morality is a remnant 
of evolution  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in 
the animal kingdom

But this doesnt get us anywhere  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant 
unless you can share them or discuss them
