WHY? HOW? MIGHT MAKES RIGHT? HOW CAN THEY FORCE THEIR MORALITY ON ME? WHY 
CAN'T I DO WHAT I WANT? WHO ARE THEY TO DECIDE? WHAT IF I DISAGREE?

GOOD POINT, BUT IT IS BEING IMMORAL IN OUR OPINION.  WE DON'T LET THEM CHOOSE,
WE MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE WRONG FOR THEM.

  FOR SOMEONE TO LAY CLAIM TO AN ALTERNATIVE
>MORAL SYSTEM, HE MUST BE SINCERE IN HIS BELIEF IN IT AND IT MUST BE
>INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.  SOME SOCIOPATHS LACK AN INNATE MORAL SENSE

I ADMIT TO LEAN TOWARD THE IDEA OF AN INNATE MORAL SENSE, BUT HAVE LITTLE BASIS
FOR IT AS OF YET.  HOW FAR CAN SUCH A CONCEPT BE EXTENDED?

 AND
>THUS MAY BE INCAPABLE OF BEHAVING MORALLY.  WHILE SOMEONE LIKE HITLER
>MAY HAVE BELIEVED THAT HIS ACTIONS WERE MORAL, WE MAY JUDGE HIM IMMORAL
>BY OUR STANDARDS.

DO YOU MEAN THAT WE COULD SAY IT WOULD BE WRONG FOR US TO DO SUCH A THING BUT 
NOT HIM.  AFTER ALL, HE WAS BEHAVING MORALLY IN HIS OWN EYES AND DOING WHAT HE
CHOSE.  ON WHAT BASIS DO WE CONDEMN OTHER SOCIETIES BESIDES, HERE'S THE BUZZ 
WORDS, ON THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE SOME ACTIONS WRONG FOR ALL HUMANS IN ALL 
SOCIETIES?

  HOLDING THAT MORALITY IS SUBJECTIVE DOES NOT MEAN
>THAT WE MUST EXCUSE THE MURDERER.

WHY NOT? DO WE HAVE TO BE OBJECTIVE SUDDENLY?
