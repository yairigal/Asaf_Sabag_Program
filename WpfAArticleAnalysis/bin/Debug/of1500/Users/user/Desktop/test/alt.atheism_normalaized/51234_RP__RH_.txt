Well now we cant judge death until we are dead right  So why should 
we judge religion without having experienced it  People have said that 
religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc 
but I dont totally agree with this  Of course we cannot really say 
how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion 
but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it 
 
So basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for 
a given individual or even for a general population  We can say that 
it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use 
religionmight be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state 
above
