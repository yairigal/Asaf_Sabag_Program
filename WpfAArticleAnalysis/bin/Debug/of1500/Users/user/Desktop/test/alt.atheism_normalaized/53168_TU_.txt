>GREGG JAEGER (JAEGER@BUPHY.BU.EDU) WROTE:

>>>AND NO, IN WESTERN COUNTRIES, IT ISN'T A "LEGAL" CONCEPT 
>>>AT ALL, SO IT'S NOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT PERTINENT TO THE
>>>TOPIC, WHICH IS A BRITISH AUTHOR LIVING IN THE UNITED 
>>>KINGDOM UNDER THE PROTECTION OF BRITISH LAW.

>>AH, YES, I KEEP FORGETTING, GOVERNMENTS ARE SUPERIOR ENTITIES TO
>>RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. FORGIVE ME -- THE GUN IS THE HIGHER LAW.

>THIS IS DEGENERATING TO 'ZUMDER LOGIC.  OF COURSE GOVERNMENTS ARE
>SUPERIOR ENTITIES, THEY ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, WHEREAS RELIGIOUS
>LEADERS CERTAINLY ARE NOT.

PERHAPS NOT IN CHRISTIANITY, BUT IN ISLAM THE CHOICE OF RELIGIOUS
LEADERS IS TO BE MADE BY THE PEOPLE. SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPERIORITY
ARGUMENT.


>  THOSE WHO THE PEOPLE TRUST TO MAKE THE LAW
>OBVIOUSLY REPRESENTS THE HIGHER LAW.  THAT IS DEMOCRACY.

DEMOCRACY IS A BASIC ELEMENT OF ISLAM. LEARN THAT ONE!

EVER NOTICE THAT THE SO-CALLED "FUNDAMENTALISTS" IN ALGERIA
WHO ARE BEING REPRESSED BY THE SECULAR GOVERNMENT WON IN
FREE AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS.
