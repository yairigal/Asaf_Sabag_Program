    WHAT DO YOU ACCEPT AS A FACT --  THE ROUNDNESS OF THE EARTH (AFTER 
ALL, THE ANCIENT GREEKS THOUGHT IT WAS A SPHERE, AND THEN NEWTON SAID 
IT WAS A SPHEROID, AND NOW PEOPLE SAY IT'S A GEOID [?])?  YOURSELF 
(ISN'T YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITY JUST A THEORETICAL CONSTRUCT TO MAKE 
SENSE OF MEMORIES, FEELINGS, PERCEPTIONS)?  I'M TRYING TO THINK OF 
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE A FACT FOR YOU.  GIVE SOME EXAMPLES, AND LET'S
SEE HOW FACTUAL THEY ARE BY YOUR CRITERIA (BTW, WHAT ARE YOUR
CRITERIA?).

    "GRAVITY IS _NOT_ A FACT": IS THAT A FACT?  HOW ABOUT NEWTON'S 
AND EINSTEIN'S THOUGHTS ABOUT GRAVITY -- IS IT A FACT THAT THEY HAD 
THOSE THOUGHTS?  I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE 
ASSERTING ARE ANY MORE FACTUAL THAN THINGS LIKE GRAVITY, ATOMS OR 
EVOLUTION.

    IN SHORT, BEFORE I AM WILLING TO CONSIDER YOUR CONCEPT OF WHAT
A FACT IS, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE,
