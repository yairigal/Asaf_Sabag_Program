WELL, AGAIN, I AM DOING AS MUCH AS THE POSTER I WAS REPLYING TOO. I AM
QUITE BUSY AND REALLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO RESPOND IN FULL SCHOLARLY
FORM TO EVERY ACCUSATION THAT IS FLIPPANTLY MADE BY SOMEONE WHO'S 
BEING CLEARLY ANTAGONISTIC.

I HAVE CONSIDERED IT. BUT IF SOMEONE SPREADS FALSEHOODS OUT OF
IGNORANCE THEN THEY ARE STILL SPREADING FALSEHOODS. THOSE FALSEHOODS
GENERALLY DO NOT COME OUT OF NOWHERE BUT ARE PRODUCED BY PEOPLE
WHO KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS (AT _LEAST_) NOT THE WHOLE
TRUTH. I STILL CONSIDER SUCH SPREADING OF FALSEHOODS PROPAGANDA
ON SOME LEVEL.

BOB, I NEVER ACCUSED YOU OF HAVING YOUR HEAD UP YOUR ASS! IT TAKES
ME QUITE SOME TIME IN DEALING WITH SOMEONE BEFORE ACCUSING THEM OF
HAVING THEIR HEAD UP THEIR ASS. I WAS ACCUSING THE ORIGINAL POSTER
(BENEDIKT, I BELIEVE) OF BEING SO IMPAIRED.


CHEERS,
