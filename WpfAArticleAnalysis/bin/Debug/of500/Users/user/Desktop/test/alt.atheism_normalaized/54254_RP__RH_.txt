Yes atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership Are you saying 
that theists claim to not have self control I dont think atheists are 
dominantly arrogant They dont claim some god that has supremacy over 
all of mankind Now this claim would be arrogant but atheists dont claim  
it Most atheists do claim to own themselves I think any disagreement with 
this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant
