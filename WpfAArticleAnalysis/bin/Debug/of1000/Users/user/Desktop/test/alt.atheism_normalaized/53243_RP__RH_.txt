You should have tried one of the socculture groups in the Middle East 
or South Asia area they are a little more open than the Islam channel   
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the  
world created itself or something like that so each particle is a God  
which created the other Gods  The soccultureafrican is also nice for  
some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion  Especially  
when Sudan is mentioned
