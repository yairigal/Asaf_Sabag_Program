EVOLUTION = THEORY
CREATION = FACT
VS                        IS THIS DEMONSTRATING THE NONSENSE PART?
EVOLUTION = ASSERTION     
CREATION = FICTION
----------------------


WHAT IS THE FACT OF EVOLUTION?  THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALLING EVOLUTION A
FACT AND TALKING ABOUT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION PROVIDING FACTS (I HAPPEN TO THINK
THE LATTER IS MORE ACCURATE ).  AND YOU SAID IT BEST YOURSELF: IF YOU ASSESS 
THE _THEORIES_ OF EVOLUTION OBJECTIVELY...  WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY,  IF YOU ASSESS 
THE _FACTS_ OF EVOLUTION OBJECTIVELY...
