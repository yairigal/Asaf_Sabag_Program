 Your wish is my command 
 
 Bill Shitstirrer Connor 
 Bobby Circular Mozumder 
 
Im not sure my new nom dnet is exactly appropriate but it comes 
very close Considering what I have to wade through before I make one 
of my insightful deadonthemoney repsonses I have to agree that 
somethings getting stirred up I would like to believe my 
characterization of what I respond to would be kinder though but if 
you insist  
 
I am also surprised to find that I have offended anyone but in some 
cases its unavoidable if I am to say anything at all For those to 
whom fairness is important check out my contributions havent I been 
most generous and patient a veritable paragon of gentility 
 
Oh BTW I dont mind being paired with Bobby I admire his tenacity 
How many of you would do as well in this hostile environment  you 
think Im offensive  read your own posts  
 
Love and kisses 
 
Bill 
 
PS 
 
My name is Conner not Connor No point in humiliating the innocents
