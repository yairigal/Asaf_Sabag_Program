The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the  
secure voice phones will use the same crypto chip as a defacto 
government standard  Problem is the government is admitting that 
they hold the keys to break the code easily and the Justice department 
will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities  Many 
people are really scared about such an initiative because it is 
a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things 
like email if you read the press release  The project was developed 
by NSA and given to NIST  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the 
government claims are needed to break the code  They claim that 
these keys will be handed to two different companies and when they 
get a warrant to do a wiretap the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip 
they have to get the keys from both companies  People have poked holes 
through and through the press release official version and shown how 
it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds and I have given the simplified 
version  People over on scicrypt are really scared about this 
proposal it seems
