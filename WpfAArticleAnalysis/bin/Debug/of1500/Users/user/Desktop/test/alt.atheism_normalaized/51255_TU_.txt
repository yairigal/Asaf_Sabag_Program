>>>AS FOR RAPE, SURELY THERE THE BURDEN OF GUILT IS SOLELY ON THE RAPIST?
>>UNLESS YOU FORCE SOMEONE TO LIVE WITH THE RAPIST AGAINST HIS WILL, IN WHICH
>>CASE PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY IS YOURS.
>I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT.  UNLESS THE RAPIST WAS HYPNOTIZED OR
>SOMETHING, I VIEW HIM AS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.

NOT NECESSARILY, ESPECIALLY IF THE RAPIST IS KNOWN AS SUCH.  FOR INSTANCE,
IF YOU INTENTIONALLY STICK YOUR FINGER INTO A LOADED MOUSETRAP AND GET
SNAPPED, WHOSE FAULT IS IT?
