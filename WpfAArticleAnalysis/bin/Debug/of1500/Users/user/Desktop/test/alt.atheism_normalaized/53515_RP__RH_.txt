Its not really their decision to be tried The rulings do have 
legal consequences but only in Islamic law and not in UK law this 
should be obvious Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making 
of a judgment Take for example the judgments of the World Court This 
is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no 
physical or economic effect but which are important despite the fact 
that their judgments cannot be enforced

Of course have you read any of this thread before this post

Of course it is a sort of anarchism Anarchism is explicitly against 
Islam Thank you for your well reasoned response but it is beside the 
points Ive been making in this thread
