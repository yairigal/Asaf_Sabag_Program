SORRY, YOU'RE RIGHT.  I DID NOT CLEARLY STATE IT.

THE MOST COMMON FORM OF CONDESCENDING IS THE RATIONAL VERSUS IRRATIONAL
ATTITUDE.  ONCE ONE HAS ACCEPTED THE _ASSUMPTION_ THAT THERE IS NO GOD(S),
AND THEN CONSIDER OTHER FAITHS TO BE IRRATIONAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR
ASSUMPTION(S) CONTRADICT YOUR ASSUMPTION, THEN I WOULD SAY THERE'S A
LACK OF CONSISTENCY HERE.

NOW I KNOW YOU'LL GET ON ME ABOUT FAITH.  IF THE _POSITIVE_ BELIEF THAT GOD
DOES NOT EXIST WERE A CLOSED, LOGICAL ARGUMENT, WHY DO SO MANY RATIONAL
PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THAT "LOGIC"?

BUT YOU, PROBABLY LIKE ME, SEEM TO BE A SOFT ATHEIST.  SORRY FOR THE FLAMAGE.

;)  WHAT IS THE CLIPPER PROJECT BTW?

IT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO ATTACK ATHEISM IN GENERAL, BUT ITS POINT WAS
THAT MASS KILLING HAPPENS FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS.  PEOPLE WILL HATE WHO
THEY WILL AND WILL WAVE WHATEVER FLAG TO JUSTIFY IT, BE IT CROSS OR
HAMMER&SICKLE.  THE STALIN EXAMPLE _IS_ IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S
STILL
