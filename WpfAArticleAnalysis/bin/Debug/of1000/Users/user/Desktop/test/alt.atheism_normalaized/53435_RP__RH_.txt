 Regardless of peoples hidden motivations the stated reasons for many 
 wars include religion  Of course you can always claim that the REAL 
 reason was economics politics ethnic strife or whatever  But the 
 fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer 
 the heathens 
 
 If you want to say for instance that economics was the chief cause 
 of the Crusades you could certainly make that point  But someone 
 could come along and demonstrate that it was REALLY something else in 
 the same manner you show that it was REALLY not religion  You could 
 in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the Crusades

I dont have to make outrageous claims about religions affecting and 
effecting history for the purpsoe of aa all I have to do point out 
that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate 
atheism At no time have I made any statement that religion was the 
sole cause of anything what I have done is point out that those who 
do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately  
 
To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to 
misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course 
history I believe that those who distort history in this way know 
exaclty what theyre doing and do it only for affect
