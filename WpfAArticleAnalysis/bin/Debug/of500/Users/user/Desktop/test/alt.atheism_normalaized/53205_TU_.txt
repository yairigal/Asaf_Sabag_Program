TWADDLE. YOU'RE OVERLOADING THE MEANING OF THE WORD "VALUE",
THAT'S ALL. WHETHER I CARE IF THE RESULTS ARE TRUE IS A "VALUE".
I FAIL TO SEE HOW WHETHER THEY ARE TRUE (CORRECT, WHATEVER) IS
A VALUE.

YOU'RE OVERLOADING THE VALUE OF WORTH, TOO.

LIKE I SAID BEFORE, DES WORKS WHETHER I VALUE MY PRIVACY OR
NOT.
