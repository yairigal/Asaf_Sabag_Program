I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout 
back in the 1960s The issue wasnt gays but the principles were the 
same Thanks for a well put testimonial Stan Krieger and his kind who 
think this discussion doesnt belong here and his intolerance is the 
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice The BSA has 
been hijacked by the religious right but some of the core values have 
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts 
havent given up Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that 
scouting is still worth fighting for 
 
On a cautionary note you must realize that if your experience with this 
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing 
it Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo
