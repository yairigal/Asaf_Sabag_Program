It is worth noting that the dozen or so references to Jesus 
outside of Christian scripture provide us *no* evidence of what 
he taught or what he did beyond the fact that the early 
Christians claimed him as their founder  All of the writers must 
have received their information from the early Christians 
perhaps second or third hand  None of these references give any 
hint that the writers had any independent information about 
Jesus  
 
These references do show that the early Christians were having an 
influence at least enough to earn a few lines here and there in 
other peoples writings  But the typical use to which they are 
put by some Christian apologists in making psuedohistorical 
arguments a la Josh is totally specious
