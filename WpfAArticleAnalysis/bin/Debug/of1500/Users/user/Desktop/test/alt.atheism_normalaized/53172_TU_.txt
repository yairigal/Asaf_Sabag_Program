>>SO, YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT ISN'T POSSIBLE FOR AN INSTINCTIVE ACT
>>TO BE MORAL ONE?  THAT IS, IN ORDER FOR AN ACT TO BE AN ACT OF MORALITY,
>>THE PERSON MUST CONSIDER THE IMMORAL ACTION BUT THEN DISREGARD IT?
>NO, I'M SAYING THAT IN ORDER FOR AN ACT TO BE MORAL OR IMMORAL, SOMEBODY/
>SOMEONE/SOMETHING MUST _CONSIDER_ IT TO BE SO.  THAT IMPLIES INTELLIGENCE,
>NOT INSTINCT.

WHO HAS TO CONSIDER IT?  THE BEING THAT DOES THE ACTION?  I'M STILL
NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY.
