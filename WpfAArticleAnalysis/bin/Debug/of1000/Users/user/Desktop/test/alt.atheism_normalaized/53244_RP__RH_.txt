What do you mean when you say I would have no objection 
 
Right I mean that I would approve of and if necessary it isnt 
assist in such force 
 
Do you mean its moral to use force on someone who advocates 
the use of force 
 
With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it 
depends on what is being forced on either side    
 
Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such 
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing 
that our own actions in doing so are not moral 
 
My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be 
immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective   
Again there many caveats and provisios 
 
Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I dont have a lock 
on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on
