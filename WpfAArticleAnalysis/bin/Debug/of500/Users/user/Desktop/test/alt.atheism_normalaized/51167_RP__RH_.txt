While mark claims that his honor would demand that he apologize it seems 
that he would apologieze *if* he were wrong which takes seeing that he 
would be wrong in some situation or other 
 
Woolfie lupus would be a cool name for a child points out that his 
brother would see himself as honorable and not see his mothers point of  
view 
 
My sister has played go between twixt me and my mother since I cant 
seem to find words that my mother understands on some issues of boundaries 
and such personal things  Not that we dont talk or anything quite so 
drastic but that it can be hard to reconsile two points of view 
 
thanks wolfie i see some of your point and mark i may see yours 
but it doesnt quite follow the same path to me as wolfes
