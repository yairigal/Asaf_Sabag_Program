WORSE?  MAYBE NOT, BUT IT IS DEFINATELY A VIOLATION OF THE
RULES THE US GOVT. SUPPOSEDLY FOLLOWS.  MAYBE THE OTHERS
SHOULD BE CHANGED TO?  BUT I'M NOT PERSONALLY AS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE ANTHEM SINCE I DON'T COME ACROSS IT IN DAILY
NEARLY UNAVOIDABLE ROUTINES.

I DON'T DESPISE THE PEOPLE...JUST THEIR OPINIONS.  I MEANT
WHEN CHATTING WITH THE ONES WHO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO ANY IDEA
OTHER THAN THEIR OWN...THEN IT JUST BECOMES AN EXERCISE FOR
AMUSEMENT.

NO.  ...NOT UNLESS THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE CURRENT ONE
WAS TO CHANGE IT TO SUCH AS THAT.
