I think this is a big leap sex>depression  One example is myself 
where no sex>depression   But seriously 1 promiscuity is on a decline 
depression is not and 2 it might be more reasonable to say  
depression>promiscuity  I think depression is more likely to come 
from emotional problems relationships family job friends and 
promiscuity is used as an escape 
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an 
emotional bond I dont see a problem with sex before not outside of 
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as 
what is expected from a married couple  Of course this is just  
my opinion
