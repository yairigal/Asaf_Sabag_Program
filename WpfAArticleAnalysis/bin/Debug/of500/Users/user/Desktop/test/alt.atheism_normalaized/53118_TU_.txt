I AGREE FULLY WITH THE ABOVE STATEMENT AND IS *PRECISELY* WHAT I MEANT
BY MY PREVIOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT ISLAM NOT BEING ANARCHIST AND THE
LAW NOT BEING _ENFORCIBLE_ DESPITE THE _LAW_ BEING APPLICABLE. 


>HENCE, ON SUCH CLARIFICATION FROM THE ULAMA [ISLAMIC SCHOLARS], MUSLIMS
>IN BRITAIN BEFORE AND AFTER IMAM KHOMEINI'S FATWA MADE IT VERY CLEAR
>THAT SINCE ISLAMIC LAW IS NOT APPLICABLE TO BRITAIN, THE HADD
>[COMPULSORY] PUNISHMENT CANNOT BE APPLIED HERE."


I DISAGREE WITH THIS CONCLUSION ABOUT THE _APPLICABILITY_ OF THE 
ISLAMIC LAW TO ALL MUSLIMS, WHEREVER THEY MAY BE. THE ABOVE CONCLUSION 
DOES NOT STRICTLY FOLLOW FROM THE FOREGOING, BUT ONLY THE CONCLUSION 
THAT THE FATWA CANNOT BE *ENFORCED* ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW. HOWEVER, 
I DO AGREE THAT THE PUNISHMENT CANNOT BE APPLIED TO RUSHDIE EVEN *WERE*
IT WELL FOUNDED.

>WOW... FROM THE ABOVE, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT FROM AN ISLAMIC VIEWPOINT
>KHOMEINI'S "FATWA" CONSTITUTES A "CRIMINAL ACT" .... PERHAPS I COULD
>EVEN GO OUT ON A LIMB AND CALL KHOMEINI A "CRIMINAL" ON THIS BASIS....


CERTAINLY PUTTING A PRICE ON THE HEAD OF RUSHDIE IN BRITAIN IS A CRIMINAL 
ACT ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW. 


>ANYHOW, I THINK IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY _KNOWLEDGEABLE_ MUSLIMS THAT
>KHOMEINI'S "FATWA" IS ISLAMICALLY ILLEGITIMATE, AT LEAST ON THE BASIS
>EXPOUNDED ABOVE.  OTHERS, SUCH AS MYSELF AND OTHERS WHO HAVE POSTED HERE
>(PARTICULARLY UMAR KHAN AND GREGG JAEGER, I THINK) GO FURTHER AND SAY
>THAT EVEN THE PUNISHMENT CONSTITUTED IN THE FATWA IS AGAINST ISLAMIC LAW
>ACCORDING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING.

YES.
