RIGHT ON, JON!  WHO CARES WHO OR WHOSE, AS LONG AS IT WORKS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.
BUT DON'T TRY TO IMPOSE THOSE BELIEFS ON US OR OUR CHILDREN.  I WOULD ADD THE
WELL-FUNDED GROUP TRIES ALSO TO PURGE SCIENCE, TO DENY CHILDREN ACCESS TO GREAT
WONDERS AND SKILLS.  AND HOW ABOUT THE KIDS BORN TO CREATIONISTS?  WHAT A
BURDEN WITH WHICH TO BEGIN ADULT LIFE.  IT MUST BE A CRUEL AWAKENING FOR THOSE
WHO FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT, PROVIDED IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE DEPTHS OF
THIS TYPE OF IGNORANCE.
