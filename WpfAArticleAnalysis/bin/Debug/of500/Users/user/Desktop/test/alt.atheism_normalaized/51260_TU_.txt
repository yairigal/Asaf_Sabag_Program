SO? NO FUN, BUT I MUST HAVE MET THE MINORITY THEN.
AND "GIVEN BY GOD" REFERS TO ANY ACTION WHEREBY A GOD
GOD CAUSES OR BETTER EFFECTS SOMETHING.
 
 
ROB, I AM NOT INTIMATE WITH JEWISH THEOLOGY, BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE A MESSIANIC JEW. CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, BUT
IT APPEARS THAT THE VIEWS OF MESSIANIC JEWS ON METAPHYSICS
IS DIFFERENT TO THAT OF THE MAJORITY OF JEWS. WHILE JEWISH
THEOLOGY OVERALL IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE CHRISTIANIC GOD
VIEWS, I HAVE HEARD THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR JEWS TO ATTRIBUTE
EVIL TO THEIR GOD, AN NO-NO FOR CHRISTIANS, THE BIBLE IS
STILL SEEN AS EFFECT OF THE INTERACTION OF SOME GOD WITH MAN.

THE CONTEXT WAS METAPHYSICS, EVEN WHEN THE PROCESS OF ADAPTING
THE COMMANDMENTS IS NOT TRANSCENDENT, THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE
PROCESS LIE IN METAPHYSIC SPECUALTION. I WONDER HOW YOU BREAK
OUT OF THE SHACKLES OF HAVING METAPHYSICS IN YOUR SYSTEM.

IS IS IN A BOOK THAT COMMANDS TO COMMIT GENOCIDE AMONG OTHER
REPREHENSIBLE DEEDS. THE CONTEXT IS REPULSIVE, AND IT IS
FOUL PLAY, IMO, TO INVOKE SOME RELATIVELY ENLIGHTENED PASSAGES
AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE CONTENT OF THE WHOLE BOOK.
