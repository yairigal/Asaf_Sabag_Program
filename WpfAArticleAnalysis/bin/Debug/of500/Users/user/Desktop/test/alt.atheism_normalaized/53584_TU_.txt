#
#GOT IT IN ONE.  SIMILARLY, A MORAL RELATIVIST WILL NOT JUDGE ONE MORAL SYSTEM
#TO BE BETTER THAN ANOTHER IN EVERY POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS DOES NOT,
#HOWEVER, PRECLUDE HIM FROM JUDGING ONE MORAL SYSTEM TO BE BETTER THAN ANOTHER
#IN A SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  NOR DOES IT PRECLUDE A SET OF MORAL
#RELATIVISTS FROM COLLECTIVELY JUDGING A MORAL SYSTEM, FROM SOME SET OF
#CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THEY ALL AGREE THEY ARE IN.

O.K., THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME.  (I'M SERIOUS, YOU'VE EXPLAINED SOMETHING
TO ME WHICH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD BEFORE).  BUT JUST FOR GRINS, SUPPOSE WE
ALMOST ALL AGREE THAT WE ARE IN A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES CALLED "REALITY".  WHAT
THEN?  OR SAY, FOR ALL PRACTICAL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THERE IS NO FRAME
OF REFERENCE IN WHICH THUS AND SUCH IS GOOD, ISN'T THAT APPROXIMATELY
OBJECTIVE, IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE USUALLY EXPECT A SPEEDING BULLET TO
OUTRUN A SNAIL?  FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HEAR OF A BOMB IN A CROWDED AREA,
ISN'T IT A RATHER SENSIBLE FIRST GUESS THAT THIS IS AN IMMORAL ACT, EVEN
THOUGH THERE CONCEIVABLY MIGHT BE SOME TAIL-END CASE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY IT?
