Oh yes he did  You may not agree with his premises and what he proved may 
not apply to reality if such a thing exists but he certainly proved 
something

Got it in one  Similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral system 
to be better than another in every possible circumstance  This does not 
however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another 
in a specific set of circumstances  Nor does it preclude a set of moral 
relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of 
circumstances which they all agree they are in 
 
OK this makes sense to me  Im serious youve explained something 
to me which I never understood before  But just for grins suppose we 
almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality  What 
then  Or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame 
of reference in which thus and such is good isnt that approximately 
objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to 
outrun a snail  For example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area 
isnt it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even 
though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it

Eh  Could you explain this  Which that statement are you talking about 
 
My own above you cant answer

I still dont quite see what youre trying to say  I assume by values you 
mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is 
a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one 
 
I mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand 
by a horse being real is pretty much what I mean about a value being real

Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite 
to me 
 
I meant that its never more than your opinion  Youve clarified this 
for me above  My understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists 
agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference 
then theyre saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes 
no different than what Im saying

Sorry but thats not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that 
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  I 
just cant provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances 
 
Logically possible or actually possible  By which I mean are you 
stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal 
switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you 
think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is 
superior to peace  Really what Im after is some order of magnitude 
on the probability you put on possible
