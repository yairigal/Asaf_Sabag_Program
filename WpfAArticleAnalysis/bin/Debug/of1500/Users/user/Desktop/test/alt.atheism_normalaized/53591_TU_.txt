THAT'S A FALLACY, AND IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT IS POINTED OUT.
FOR ONE, YOU HAVE NEVER GIVEN A SET OF MORALS PEOPLE AGREE UPON. UNLIKE
A FOOTBALL. FURTHER, YOU CONVENIENTLY IGNORE HERE THAT THERE ARE
MANY WHO WOULD NOT AGREE ON TGHE MORALITY OF SOMETHING. THE ANALOGY
DOES NOT HOLD.
 
ONE CAN EXPECT SUFFICIENTLY MANY PEOPLE TO AGREE ON ITS BEING A FOOTBALL,
WHILE YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THAT ONLY VANISHING NUMBER DISAGREES
WITH A SET OF MORALS YOU HAVE TO GIVE.
 
FURTHER, THE ABOVE IS EVIDENCE, NOT PROOF. PROOF WOULD EVOLVE OUT OF TESTING
YOUR THEORY OF ABSOLUTE MORALS AGAINST COMPETING THEORIES.
 
 
THE ABOVE IS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU REITERATE WHILE YOU NEVER ANSWER
THE OBJECTIONS. EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE A PREACHER.
