I GUESS I'M DELVING INTO A RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE AREA.  WHAT EXACTLY IS MORALITY 
OR MORALS?  I NEVER THOUGHT OF EATING MEAT TO BE MORAL OR IMMORAL, BUT I THINK
IT COULD BE.  HOW DO WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NOT DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS
A PERSONAL CHOICE OR PREFERENCE AND NOT DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE WE SEE IT AS 
IMMORAL?  DO WE FALL TO WHAT THE BASIS OF THESE MORALS ARE?

ALSO, CONSENSUS POSITIONS FALL TO A MIGHT MAKES RIGHT.  OR, AS YOU BROUGHT OUT,
IF WHATEVER IS RIGHT IS WHAT IS SOCIETALLY MANDATED THEN WHOEVER IS IN CONTROL
AT THE TIME MAKES WHAT IS RIGHT
