Dont listen to this guy hes just a crank  At first this business 
about being the one true god was tolerated by the rest of us 
but now it has gotten completely out of hand 
 
Besides it really isnt so bad when people stop believing in you 
Its much more relaxing when mortals arent always begging you for favors
