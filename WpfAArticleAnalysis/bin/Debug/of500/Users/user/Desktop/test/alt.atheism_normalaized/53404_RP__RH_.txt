I dont necessarily disagree with your assertion but I disagree with 
your reasoning  Faith = Bad  Dogma = Bad  Religion > Faith  Dogma 
Religion > Bad  Bad  Religion > Bad  Unfortunately you never  
state why faith and dogma are dangerous   
 
If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in 
Waco you are missing the point   
 
The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the 
messenger  They believed Koresh was a prophet and therefore believed 
everything he said  The problem wasnt the religion it was the  
followers  They didnt die because of faith and dogma they died because 
of their zealotry or in the case of the children the zealotry of their 
parents

So Christians are totally irrational  Irrational with respect to their 
religion only  What are you saying  Ones belief in a Christian God does 
not make one totally irrational  I think I know what you were getting at 
but Id rather hear you expand on the subject

Again this statement is too general  A Christian is perfectly capable of 
being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing hisher mind  Faith in 
God is a belief and all beliefs may change  Would you assert that atheists 
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a 
God which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion
