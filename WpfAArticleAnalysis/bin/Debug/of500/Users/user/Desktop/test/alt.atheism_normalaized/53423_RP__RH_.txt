As many posters have said in as many posts lately this is just 
not true  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no 
faith at all  You make the presumption that the knowledge of the  
possibility of something is enough to require faith to render  
that possibilty of no interest  It is a very different thing to say 
that you dont believe something than it is to say that you dont 
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  
think about  Its not either or  Sometimes is just something else 
more interesting that occupies your mind   
 
I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable but not necessarily 
applied to god and religion  It takes both faith and dogma to 
expect the sun to come up every morning but there is overwhelming 
reason every single day day in and day out for everyone to put  
his faith and dogma there  Not so with the christian religion
