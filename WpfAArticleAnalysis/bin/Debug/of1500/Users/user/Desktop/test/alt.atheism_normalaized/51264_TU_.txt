AHHHHH, BUT THAT *IS* THE POINT.   HONOR SHOULD DEMAND THAT EACH OF THEM
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ERROR/FAULT/MISUNDERSTANDING APLENTY IN THE
SITUATION, AND TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER.

BUT, SINCE THERE IS NO HONOR *BETWEEN* THE TWO OF THEM, THEY HOLD TO
THEIR OWN THICKHEADED PATHS, REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER AS HUMAN,
AND DRAGGING THE FAMILY FEUD OUT INTO THE FUTURE.

HONOR IS BOTH AN INDIVIDUAL TRAIT, AND A CONTRACT *BETWEEN* TWO OR MORE
FOLK.
