Well this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over 
into altatheism where we spend most of our time entertaining 
arguments against our belief system without resorting to accusing 
others of bigotry  Its somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry 
happens in this instance to have originated in recscouting since I 
always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity  I 
understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who 
happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or 
other inconsequential characteristics  All the evidence Ive seen 
indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are 
exactly such inconsequential characteristics  Thus pending further 
evidence I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people 
are bigots and organizations that exclude such people are 
discriminatory
