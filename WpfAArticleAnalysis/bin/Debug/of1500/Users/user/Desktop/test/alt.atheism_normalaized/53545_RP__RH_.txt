To repeat what I said in an earlier post Evolution is theory and fact  If you 
accept the facts then that is a display of reason and intelligence and much 
different from anachronistic religion  If you assess the theories of evolution 
objectively then there can be 0 religion involved and evolution remains 
useful in the realm of science 
 
Simply put evolutioncreation when each is looked at properly  theoryfact 
vs assertionfiction  is a specific example of exactly what separates reason 
and science from nonsense
