Well as I remember Jacobys Mythmaker talks about this to cite 
one source  but Im not sure if all Christians have read this book 
In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated 
as a Lutheran having a lot of Christian friends and I even 
have played in two Christian rock bands 
 
So over to you do you have any counter claims sources et  
rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept 
of a social promise that is independent on the social status 
 
Cheers
