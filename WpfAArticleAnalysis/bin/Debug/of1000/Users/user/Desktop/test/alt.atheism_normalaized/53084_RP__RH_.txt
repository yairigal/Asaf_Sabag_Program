Im afraid its much worse than this Jesus said follow the Ten 
Commandments AND the Torah And the Prophets Christians on the other 
hand are not only above the Ten Commandments AND the Torah AND the 
Prophets ie they believe that they do not have to follow it they 
dont even follow the subjective morality of Jesus So we see that 
Christians cant follow the objective morality of their own Ten 
Commandments they cant follow the subjective morality of Jesus when 
He said follow the Ten Commandments yet they expect the rest of the 
world to do what Is there any logic here Is there any morality here 
objective or subjective Is Christianity somebodys idea of a joke Who 
could be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many Christians Who could 
be such a great deceiver
