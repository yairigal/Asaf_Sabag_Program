Sure Yes I did You see I dont think that rape and murder should 
be dealt with lightly You being so interested in leniency for 
leniencys sake apparently think that people should simply be 
told the did a bad thing

I suspect that its pretty unlikely that given my requirement 
of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very likely
