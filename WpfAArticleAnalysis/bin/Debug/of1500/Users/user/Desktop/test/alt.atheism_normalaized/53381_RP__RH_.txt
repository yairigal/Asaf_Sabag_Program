Hmm USENET got its collective hooks into me around 1987 or so right after I 
switched to engineering  Id say I started reading altatheism around 198889 
Ive probably not posted more than 50 messages in the time since then though 
Ill never understand how people can find the time to write so much  I 
can barely keep up as it is
