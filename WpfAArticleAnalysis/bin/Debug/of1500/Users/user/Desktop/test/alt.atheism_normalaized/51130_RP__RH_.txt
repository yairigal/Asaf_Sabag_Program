Thats right and this is pretty impossible right  It would be ideal if 
we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then 
determine which course of thought suits us best  But again this is not 
possible  Not that religion warrants belief but the belief carries with 
it some psychological benefits  There are also some psychological 
burdens too

Well if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism 
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing 
in racism  Of course the parallel happens to be a poor one but you 
originated it
