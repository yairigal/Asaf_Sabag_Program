Another Gedanken experiment is selling the London bridge adjusted to 
this situation selling USA for 1 to a foreign tourist Yet again 
is this an objective deal 
 
Good question  Under the assumption that things are as they are 
and the seller is not the owner I assume this is what you mean 
then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal 
for any tourist regardless of their private beliefs  There isnt 
enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller  but one 
could say with less confidence that it can be a good deal for any seller   
That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is  
*not* relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can  
predict this which sounds pretty objective to me
