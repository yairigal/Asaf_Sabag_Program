#(DELETION)
# 
#>|THEISM IS CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM. I HAVE NEITHER SAID THAT ALL FANATISM
#>|IS CAUSED BY THEISM NOR THAT ALL THEISM LEADS TO FANATISM. THE POINT IS,
#>|THEISM INCREASES THE CHANCE OF BECOMING A FANATIC. ONE COULD OF COURSE
#>|ARGUE THAT WOULD BE FANATICS TEND TOWARDS THEISM (FOR EXAMPLE), BUT I JUST
#>|HAVE TO LOOOK AT THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN THEISM WAS THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY
#>|TO INVALIDATE THAT CONCLUSION THAT THAT IS THE BASIC MECHANISM BEHIND IT.
#>
#>IMO, THE INFLUENCE OF STALIN, OR FOR THAT MATTER, AYN RAND, INVALIDATES YOUR
#>ASSUMPTION THAT THEISM IS THE FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED.
# 
#BOGUS. I JUST SAID THAT THEISM IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR FOR FANATISM.
#THE POINT IS THAT THEISM IS *A* FACTOR.

THAT'S YOUR CLAIM; NOW BACK IT UP.  I CONSIDER YOUR ARGUMENT AS USEFUL
AS THE FOLLOWING:  BELIEF IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH FANATICISM.  THEREFORE
BELIEF IS *A* FACTOR IN FANATICISM.  TRUE, AND UTTERLY USELESS.  (NOTE, THIS
IS *ANY* BELIEF, NOT BELIEF IN GODS)

#>GULLIBILITY,
#>BLIND OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY, LACK OF SCEPTICISM, AND SO ON, ARE ALL MORE
#>RELIABLE INDICATORS.  AND THE REALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE - THE SOURCES OF
#>FANATICISM - ARE OFTEN NONE OF THESE THINGS.  THEY ARE CYNICAL MANIPULATORS
#>OF THE GULLIBLE, WHO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
# 
#THAT'S A CLAIM YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT. PLEASE NOTE THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE
#FIELD OF THEISM, THE LEADERS BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY.

IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, YOU'RE INCREDIBLY NAIVE.

#>NOW, *SOME*
#>BRANDS OF THEISM, AND MORE PRECISELY *SOME* THEISTS, DO TEND TO FANATICISM,
#>I GRANT YOU.  TO TAR ALL THEISTS WITH THIS BRUSH IS BIGOTRY, NOT A REASONED
#>ARGUMENT - AND IT READS TO ME LIKE A WARM-UP FOR CENSORSHIP AND RESTRICTION
#>OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  EVER READ ANIMAL FARM?
#>
#THAT'S A STRAW MAN. AND AS USUALLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ONE HAS TO
#REPEAT IT: READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE: NOT EVERY THEISM LEADS TO
#FANATISM, AND NOT ALL FANATISM IS CAUSED BY THEISM. THE POINT IS,
#THERE IS A CORRELATION, AND IT COMES FROM INNATE FEATURES OF THEISM.

NO, SOME OF IT COMES FROM FEATURES WHICH *SOME* THEISM HAS IN COMMON
WITH *SOME* FANATICISM.    YOUR LAST STATEMENT SIMPLY ISN'T IMPLIED BY
WHAT YOU SAY BEFORE, BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO SNEAK IN "INNATE FEATURES
OF [ALL] THEISM".  THE WORD YOU'RE GROPING FOR IS "SOME".

#GULLIBILITY, BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THEM.

NO SHIT, SHERLOCK.  SO WHY NOT TALK ABOUT GULLIBILITY INSTEAD OF THEISM,
SINCE IT SEEMS A WHOLE LOT MORE RELEVANT TO THE CASE YOU HAVE, AS OPPOSED
TO THE CASE YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE?

#AND TO SAY THAT I AM GOING TO FORBID RELIGION IS ANOTHER OF YOUR STRAW
#MEN. INTERESTING THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER.

I SAID IT READS LIKE A WARM UP TO THAT.  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN IRRATIONAL
AND BOGUS TIRADE, AND
