Hi 
 
I dont know much about Mormons and I want to know about serious independent 
studies about the Book of Mormon 
 
I dont buy the official story about the gold original taken to heaven 
but havent read the Book of Mormon by myself I have to much work learning 
Biblical Hebrew I will appreciate any comment about the results of study 
in style vocabulary placenames internal consistency and so on 
 
For example There is evidence for onewriter or multiple writers 
There are some mention about events places or historical persons later 
discovered by archeologist 
 
Yours in Collen
