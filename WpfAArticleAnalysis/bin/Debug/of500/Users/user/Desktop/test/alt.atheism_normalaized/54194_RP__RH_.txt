I disagree  In the end the *individual* is responsible for hisher own 
irrationality  The individuals belief in some dogmatic religion is a  
symptom of that irrationality 
 
>Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists 
 
Atheists and agnostics I would imagine but yes that was my point  An 
atheist would theoretically be just as illequipped to study the philosophy 
of religion as a Christian and yet there is a persistence of atheists 
among the ranks of philosophers  Therefore the conflict between ones 
religious beliefs or lack thereof and the ability to be a philosopher 
must not be as great as you assert  The fact that most philosophers may 
be nonreligious was a secondary point

As opposed to science practiced by theists  Be careful here 
 
Science does have a builtin defence against faith and dogma 
skepticism  Unfortunately it is not foolproof  There is that  
wonderful little creature known as the theory  Many of us believe in 
the theory of evolution  We have no absolute proof that this  
theory is true so why do we believe it  Because it makes more  
sense than  There is quite a bit of faith involved here

Well not ALL current beliefs are deficient but basically I agree

Ideally this is true  In reality though you have to acknowledge 
that scientists are human  Scientists have egos and biases  Some 
scientists assume a particular theory is true refuse to admit the 
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever and proceed 
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof  
for the theory  Remember cold fusion

Not really  I agree that we spent far too
