At the cost of repudiating the FAQ I think too much is made of the 
strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of altatheism 
where were continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists 
believe in the nonexistence of god I think the separation is a 
valid one 
 
To cover my arse what Im trying to say is that there is an 
infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between 
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism I wish  Whereas I 
logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect I am 
a strong atheist and wish I could be a mathematical one  To 
justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that 
the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny 
is faulty 
 
If I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god 
generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been 
found to be unassailable  To me this is adequate evidence that the 
realgod is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been 
found to be watertight which in turn I accept as sufficient to 
base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god 
 
Im a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome 
but perhaps we should change the thread subject
