I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A 10 YEAR PERIOD FROM TIME OF DEATH UNTIL
A PERSON CAN BE ON A COMMEMORATIVE STAMP.  IT WAS BROKEN ONCE
FOR LYNDON JOHNSON (I THINK) BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT HAS HELD FOR
AWHILE.  OF COURSE, WE CAN STILL START NOW -- THE ELVIS STAMP
WAS PETITIONED FOR AGES AND THINGS REALLY MOVED ONCE IT GOT
PAST THE 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH.
