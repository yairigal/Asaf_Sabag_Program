I dont accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful 
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make 
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is 
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we 
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on 
objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not  
a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects  
behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a 
simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that  
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you  
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly  
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great  
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution 
is no different
