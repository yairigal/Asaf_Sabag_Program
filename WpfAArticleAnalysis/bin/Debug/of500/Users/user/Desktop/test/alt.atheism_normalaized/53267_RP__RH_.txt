Get a grip man  The Stalin example was brought up not as an 
indictment of atheism but merely as another example of how people will 
kill others under any name thats fit for the occasion

So hard atheism has nothing to prove  Then how does it justify that 
God does not exist  I know theres the FAQ etc  But guess what  if 
those justifications were so compelling why arent people flocking to 
hard atheism  Theyre not and they wont  I for one will discourage 
people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable 
statements on hard atheism 
 
Second what makes you think Im defending any given religion  Im merely 
recognizing hard atheism for what it is a faith 
 
And yes by we I am referring to every reader of the post  Where is the 
evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon
