Well that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much 
we wanted the 1 wouldnt it 
 
Yes it would  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality  If I can 
predict with almost 100 accuracy that Americans prefer to own their portions of 
the US than an infinitesmal portion of 1 in what sense are these values 
not objective  I dont think Im way off beam in saying that something is 
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation Do you agree 
with me then that the assertion no values are objective is false
