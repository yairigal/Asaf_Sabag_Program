YOUR POSTING PROVOKED ME INTO CHECKING MY SAVE FILE FOR MEMORABLE
POSTS. THE FIRST I CAPTURED WAS BY KEN ARROMDEE ON 19 FEB 1990, ON THE
SUBJECT "RE: ATHEIST TOO?". THAT WAS ARTICLE #473 HERE; YOUR QUESTION
WAS ARTICLE #53766, WHICH IS AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 48 ARTICLES A DAY FOR
THE LAST THREE YEARS. AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED, THE CURRENT POSTING RATE IS
SUCH THAT MY KILL FILE IS DEPRESSING LARGE...... AMONG THE POSTING I
SAVED IN THE EARLY DAYS WERE ARTICLES FROM THE FOLLOWING NOTABLES:

>FROM: LOREN@SUNLIGHT.LLNL.GOV (LOREN PETRICH)
>FROM: JCHRIST@NAZARETH.ISRAEL.REL (JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH)
>FROM: MRC@TOMOBIKI-CHO.CAC.WASHINGTON.EDU (MARK CRISPIN)
>FROM: PERRY@APOLLO.HP.COM (JIM PERRY)
>FROM: LIPPARD@UAVAX0.CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU (JAMES J. LIPPARD)
>FROM: MINSKY@MEDIA.MIT.EDU (MARVIN MINSKY)

AN INTERESTING BUNCH.... I WONDER WHERE #2 IS?
