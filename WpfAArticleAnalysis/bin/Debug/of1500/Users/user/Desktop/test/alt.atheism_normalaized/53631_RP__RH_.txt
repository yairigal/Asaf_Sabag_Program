An obvious effect of homosexuality is nonprocreation  That unlike your 
statement is a fact  Please prove that a homosexuality is defended as  
means of population control b being atheist causes you to hold these 
beliefs  I defend homosexuality because a what people do with their 
bodies is none of my business b I defend the equal rights of 
all humans  Do you

Prove your statement  Electrons are waves  Electrons are particles  I  
believe in both  I have physical proof of both  I have no proof of godtm 
only an ancient book  That is not indicative of the existence of a being 
with omnipotence or omnipresence  And by your own argument christians 
dont exist

First of all your earlier statements have absolutely nothing to do 
with your question  Why did you post them  To show that athiests 
besides not existing your view are more humane than christiansother 
religions 
 
 
Secondly I am very much for the control of population growth 
 
The logic that you cannot grasp indicates ignorance of contraception 
But of course this is outlawed sometimes literally by religion 
since if it cant create more followers it will die
