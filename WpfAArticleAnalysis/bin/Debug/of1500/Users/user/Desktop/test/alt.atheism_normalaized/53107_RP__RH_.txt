	One need not have have the notion that science is useful For  
example many Christian scientists do not believe medical science to be  
usefor or worthy That does not make medical science subjective 
 
	In any event I fail to see what you mean by subjective science 
Are you suggesting that it is and that if I step of a building I may fall  
while you may not 
 
	I assure you it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall  
 without any other outside means of support  If you do not believe this  
I suggest you step off of a building and subjectively believe that you will  
not fall
