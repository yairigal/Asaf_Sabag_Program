  Damn right you cant provide any evidence for it   
 
  Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a 
  simple premise  If they were psychology would be a hard science 
  with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics   
 
  Your premise may well be right  It is much more likely however 
  that it reflects your socialization and religious background as 
  well as your need to validate your religious beliefs  Were I to 
  pretend to have all the answers and I dont I would say that the 
  xenophobia guilt and intolerance brought about by adherence to  
  fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing 
  the members of our society 
 
  Your mileage obviously varies
