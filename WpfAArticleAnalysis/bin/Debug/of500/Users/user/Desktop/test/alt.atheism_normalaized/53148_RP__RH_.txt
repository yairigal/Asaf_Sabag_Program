Yup  This is me  I dont know why it crossposted  I was accessing nn  
from another system and that might have caused the glitch 
 
I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or  
application of it  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth  
that is truth even though I may not know about it   
 
Some morals I wouldnt want to change and would not consider it progress  
for 
a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok  Some underlying  
themes morality honesty courage respect etc are used to base  
actions  I dont consider the idea that we should have been moral should  
be moral now and should be so in the future a limitation when it includes  
such morality  Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry 
someone of the opposite sex it is immoral to listen to rock and roll etc  
seem to be different than the above lists and if specific actions are given 
moral status I tend to question those morals
