For me it is a I believe no gods exist and a I dont believe gods exist 
  
In other words I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere 
with this world are false or meaningless In Ontology one can fairly 
conclude that when A exist is meaningless A does not exist Under the 
Pragmatic definition of truth A exists is meaningless makes A exist 
even logically false 
  
A problem with such statements is that one cant disprove a subjective god 
by definition and there might be cases where a subjective god would even 
make sense The trouble with most god definitions is that they include 
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting 
all Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others
