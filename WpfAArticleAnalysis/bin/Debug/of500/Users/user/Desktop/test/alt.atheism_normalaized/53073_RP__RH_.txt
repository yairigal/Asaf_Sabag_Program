+Last night while watching the 2am rebroadcast of Jerry Springer a 
+talk show I heard this Jewel of a thought from a 12 year old racist  
+The focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the Jewish 
+religion and why   
 
some stuff deleted 
 
+Interesting and scary no  They went on to say how the Jews had  
+killed their god and how in the end of time that all the races would 
+go to their homelands of course they would remain in America which 
+is New Jeruselem as it says in Gen 2 what another kid said but 
+the rest of the races would go home and then the great battle or plague 
+or whatever Revel says would happen and the jews would be killed 
+ 
+The most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is Catholic  
+and had the KJV of the Bible on his desk  He immediatly opened it up 
+and began to search for the quoted passages Gen Rev and John to  
+look for himself and couldnt find what they said they saw  I dont 
+know 
 
I saw this show a while back and when I heard these kids 
quote the Bible to justify their racist claims I looked up 
that quote about Jesus hating Jews since Jesus himself was a 
Jew my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim 
The jist of the passage and I am sorry but I cant recall 
which passage it was exactly was that Jesus was condemning 
the Pharisees for being corrupt 
Of course the Pharisees were Jewish too but it wasnt Jews 
as a whole that Jesus was condemning just the powers that be
