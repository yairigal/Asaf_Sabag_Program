Thats a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out 
For one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon Unlike 
a football Further you conveniently ignore here that there are 
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something The analogy 
does not hold 
  
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football 
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees 
with a set of morals YOU have to give 
  
Further the above is evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of testing 
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories 
  
  
The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer 
the objections Evidence that you are a preacher
