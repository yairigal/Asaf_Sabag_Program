I bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British 
Government banning it  Theres nothing interests me in a book more than 
making it illegal 
 
However its still sitting on my shelf unread  Perhaps Ill get round to it 
soon  Ive still got a pile of Lem Bulgakov and Zamyatin to go through I 
dont find nearly enough time to read  In fact there are far more 
interesting things to do than I can ever find time for how anyone ever 
manages to be bored is beyond me  If I didnt have to sleep maybe I could 
manage it
