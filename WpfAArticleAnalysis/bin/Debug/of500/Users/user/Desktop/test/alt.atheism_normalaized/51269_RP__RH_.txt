Well its obvious that you *dont* attempt otherwise you would be aware 
that they *dont* all loudly claim to be the One True Christian 
 
Ive tried to avoid using the phrase isis not christian because of these 
ownership issues instead Ive tried the phrase Nicene christianity in an 
attempt to identify the vast majority of christianity which has roughly 
similar viewpoints on the core theological issues  The JWs do not fall 
within this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism which is 
rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well
