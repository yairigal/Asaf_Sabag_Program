JAMES FELDER (SPBACH@LERC.NASA.GOV) WROTE:

: LOGIC ALERT -  ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY.  JUST BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR YOU 
: TO BELIEVE THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT ISN'T TRUE.  LIARS CAN BE VERY PURSUASIVE
: JUST LOOK AT KORESH THAT YOU YOURSELF CITE.

THIS IS WHOLE BASIS OF A GREAT MANY HERE REJECTING THE CHRISTIAN
ACCOUNT OF THINGS. IN THE WORDS OF ST. MADALYN MURREY-O'HAIR, "FACE IT
FOLKS, IT'S JUST SILLY ...". WHY IS IT OKAY TO DISBELIEVE BECAUSE OF
YOUR INCREDULITY IF YOU ADMIT THAT IT'S A FALLACY?
