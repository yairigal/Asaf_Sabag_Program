IT WOULD PROBABLY HELP YOUR EDUCATION IF YOU ACTUALLY READ SOME
OF ELDRIDGE'S BOOKS, INSTEAD OF QUOTING EXCERPTS FROM SOME FACT SHEET.

YES, ELDRIDGE DOESN'T GO ALONG WITH GRADUALISM 100%.   HOWEVER,
IN TIME FRAMES HE RELATES HOW ONE CAN SOMETIMES TRACE THE GRADUAL
DEVELOPMENT OF A FEATURE - IN THIS CASE TRILOBITE EYE - OVER TIME
SCALES AS LONG AS MILLIONS OF YEARS.
