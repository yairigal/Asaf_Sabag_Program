I am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here 
on the net  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this 
group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief  I would 
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and 
mail it back to me at mtabbottunixamherstedu   
 
First of all Ive tried to structure questions that can be answered in a 
variety of ways with varying amounts of detail its possible to give  
succinct answers to most everything but theres enough here to keep most of  
you typing for hours Im sure  As much detail as you want to give me I mean  
it is great but its also important for me to have as broad a base of  
individuals as possible so even minimal responses are far better than nothing 
 its a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration   
 
Secondly I hope some of the questions dont come off as obnoxious I know that 
phrases like What would convince you of the existence of God imply that I am 
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens 
In fact Im not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself so my 
use of God is a question of locution rather than ideology  its easier  
than just repeating a deity or higher power every time   
 
Also I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system 
although I know some of you might contend that you dont have ANY beliefs but 
are skeptical towards everything  I understand but you know what I mean 
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  
required to get the precise idea across   
 
Lastly thanks  Please fill out as much as you can in as much detail as 
you can and send them to me  My research and I thank you   
 
 
 
Where would you place your beliefs on the spectrum

Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs   
 
 
In what if any religious tradition were you raised  Did you ever believe  
in the existence of a God  Several of the following questions presume  
that the answer to this is yes if youve always been an atheist or at 
least never a theist you may have to modify the questionanswer somewhat 
 
 
How serious was youryour familys involvement   
 
How and when did you start to doubt
