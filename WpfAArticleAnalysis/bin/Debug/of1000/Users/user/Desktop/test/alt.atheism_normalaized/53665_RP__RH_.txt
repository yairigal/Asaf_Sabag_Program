Not necessarily It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis If 
all or most of the copies that were available when printing became 
common were decended from the same copy a change in that copy would 
propagate to all modern copies even if there were other copies in  
existence at the time of the change Very few libraries would have 
duplicates of a nonreligious book so there would be few opportunities 
for anyone to notice that there were variations Even if someone did 
notice they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed 
to their expectations and ignore the others
